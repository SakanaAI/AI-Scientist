# AI-Scientist Improvement Plans

This directory contains comprehensive plans for improving the AI-Scientist project.

## Contents

### Improvement Plans

- [**improvements_todo.md**](improvements_todo.md): A comprehensive list of all planned improvements organized by area
- [**implementation_roadmap.md**](implementation_roadmap.md): A prioritized roadmap for implementing improvements in phases

### Design Documents

- [**design_modular_architecture.md**](design_modular_architecture.md): Detailed design for the modular architecture redesign
- [**frontend_development_plan.md**](frontend_development_plan.md): Comprehensive plan for developing the web front-end interface

## Getting Started

1. Review the improvements_todo.md file to understand the full scope of planned enhancements
2. Refer to the implementation_roadmap.md for prioritization and phasing of work
3. Use the design documents as a starting point for implementation

## Contributing New Improvement Ideas

To contribute a new improvement idea:

1. Add it to the appropriate section in [improvements_todo.md](improvements_todo.md)
2. For significant improvements, create a new design document in this directory
3. Update the implementation_roadmap.md if needed to include the new improvement

## Implementation Status

Track the current status of implementations by updating the checkboxes in the improvements_todo.md file:

- [ ] Unchecked items are not yet implemented
- [x] Checked items are completed

## Next Steps

The highest priority improvements to focus on initially are:

1. Modular Architecture Redesign
2. Infrastructure Improvements (containerization, testing)
3. Documentation and Code Quality improvements
4. Front-End Foundation development

See [implementation_roadmap.md](implementation_roadmap.md) for more details on the phased approach.
