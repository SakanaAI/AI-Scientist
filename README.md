One of the grand challenges of artificial intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used to aid human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas or writing code, they still require extensive manual supervision or are heavily constrained to a specific task.

We're excited to introduce **The AI Scientist**, the first comprehensive system for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling Foundation Models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform research independently.

We further provide all runs and data from our paper [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G7A0wTqfXVa-cpexjk0oaXakaSJwffEt?usp=sharing), where we run each base model on each template for ~50 ideas. We *highly* recommend reading through some of the [Claude papers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mmpz6M1FK4q8e-SewgZcUzdeD0Q2zC39?usp=sharing), (especially the diffusion ones), to get a sense of its strengths and weaknesses.

## Requirements

### Installation

```bash
conda create -n ai_scientist python=3.11
conda activate ai_scientist
# Install pdflatex
sudo apt-get install texlive-full

# Install pypi requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When installing `texlive-full`, you may need to [hold Enter](https://askubuntu.com/questions/956006/pregenerating-context-markiv-format-this-may-take-some-time-takes-forever).

### API Keys

#### OpenAI API (GPT-4)

By default, this uses the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

#### Anthropic API (Claude Sonnet 3.5)

By default, this uses the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

For Claude models provided by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), please specify a set of valid [AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) and the target [AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-regions.html):

(*required*) `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, (*optional*) `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

#### DeepSeek API (DeepSeek-Coder-V2)

By default, this uses the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable.

#### OpenRouter API (Llama3.1)

By default, this uses the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable.

#### Semantic Scholar API (Literature Search)

Our code can also optionally use a Semantic Scholar API Key (`S2_API_KEY`) for higher throughput [if you have one](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api), though in principle it should work without it.

Be sure to provide the key for the model used for your runs, e.g.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR KEY HERE"
export S2_API_KEY="YOUR KEY HERE"
```

### Setup NanoGPT

# Set up NanoGPT baseline run
# NOTE: YOU MUST FIRST RUN THE PREPARE SCRIPTS ABOVE!
cd templates/nanoGPT && python experiment.py --out_dir run_0 && python plot.py
```

#### Create NanoGPT_lite baseline run. We use this for sanity-checking
```bash
# NOTE: YOU MUST FIRST RUN THE PREPARE SCRIPTS ABOVE!
cd templates/nanoGPT_lite && python experiment.py --out_dir run_0 && python plot.py
```

### Setup 2D Diffusion

## Run AI Scientist Paper Generation Experiments

**Note:** please ensure the setup steps above are completed.

```bash
conda activate ai_scientist
# Run the paper generation.
python launch_scientist.py --model "gpt-4o-2024-05-13" --experiment nanoGPT_lite --num-ideas 2
python launch_scientist.py --model "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620" --experiment nanoGPT_lite --num-ideas 2
```

## Getting an LLM Generated Paper Review

```python
import openai
from ai_scientist.perform_review import load_paper, perform_review

client = openai.OpenAI()
model = "gpt-4o-2024-05-13"

# Load paper from pdf file (raw text)
paper_txt = load_paper("report.pdf")
# Get the review dict of the review
review = perform_review(
    paper_txt,
    model,
    client,
    num_reflections=5,
    num_fs_examples=1,
    num_reviews_ensemble=5,
    temperature=0.1,
)

# Inspect review results
review["Overall"]  # overall score 1-10
review["Decision"]  # ['Accept', 'Reject']
review["Weaknesses"]  # List of weaknesses (str)
```

To run batch analysis:

```bash
cd review_iclr_bench
python iclr_analysis.py --num_reviews 500  --batch_size 100 --num_fs_examples 1 --num_reflections 5 --temperature 0.1 --num_reviews_ensemble 5
```

## Making your own Template

If there is an area of study you would like **The AI Scientist** to explore, it should be very easy to create your own templates. In general, follow the structure of the existing templates, which consists of:

- `experiment.py` -- This is a single file where the 'meat' of the content is. It takes in an argument for `out_dir`, which is where it should create the folder and save the relevant information from the run.
- `plot.py` -- This should take in the information from the `run` folders and create plots. The code should be clear and easy to edit.
- `prompt.json` -- Put information about your template here.
- `seed_ideas.json` -- Put example ideas here. You can also try to generate ideas without any examples, and then pick the best one or two to put here.
- `latex/template.tex` -- We recommend using our latex folder, but be sure to replace the pre-loaded citations with ones that you would expect to be more relevant.
   
## Template Resources

We provide 3 templates, which heavily use code from other repositories, which we credit below. (Normally, we would do this in the files themselves, but it's unclear how this would affect The AI Scientist since it would be visible).

The NanoGPT template used code from [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and this [PR](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/pull/254).

The 2D Diffusion template used code from [tiny-diffusion](https://github.com/tanelp/tiny-diffusion), [ema-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/ema-pytorch), and [Datasaur](https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/same-stats-different-graphs/).

The Grokking template used code from [Sea-Snell/grokking](https://github.com/Sea-Snell/grokking) and [danielmamay/grokking](https://github.com/danielmamay/grokking).

We would like to thank the developers of the open-source models and packages for their contributions and for making their work available.

## FAQ

We recommend reading our paper in the first instance for any questions you have on The AI Scientist.

### Why am I missing files when running The AI Scientist?
Make sure you have completed all the setup and preparation steps before the main experiment script.

### Why has a PDF or a review not been generated?
The AI Scientist finishes an idea with a success rate that depends on both the template, the base foundation model, and the complexity of the idea. We advise referring to our main paper. The highest success rates are observed with Claude Sonnet 3.5.
Reviews are best done with GPT-4o, all other models have issues with positivity bias or failure to conform to required outputs.

### What is the cost of each idea generated?
Typically less than $15 per paper with Claude Sonnet 3.5. We recommend DeepSeek Coder V2 for a much more cost-effective approach. A good place to look for new models is the [Aider leaderboard](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/).

### How do I change the base conference format associated with the write-ups?
Change the base `template.tex` files contained within each template.

### How do I run The AI Scientist for different subject fields?
Please refer to the instructions for different templates. In this current iteration, this is restricted to ideas that can be expressed in code. However, lifting this restriction would represent exciting future work! :)

### How do I add support for a new foundation model?
Please see this [PR](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist/pull/7) for an example of how to add a new model, e.g. this time for Claude via Bedrock.
We do not advise any model that is significantly weaker than GPT-4 level for The AI Scientist.
