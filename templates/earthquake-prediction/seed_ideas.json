    "Experiment": "1. Integrate a CNN layer before the LSTM to extract spatial features from input data. 2. Implement a single global attention mechanism to weigh the extracted features dynamically. 3. Modify the LSTMCell to accept attended features as input. 4. Train the model and compare prediction metrics with the baseline LSTM model. 5. Analyze attention weights to understand model focus areas.",
