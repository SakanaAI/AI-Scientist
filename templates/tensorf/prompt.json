    "task_description": "You are given the following file to work with, which implements TensoRF (Tensorial Radiance Fields) for efficient 3D scene representation and view synthesis. The goal is to generate high-quality renderings of scenes with minimal artifacts and to maximize the diversity of rendered scenes without increasing the rank of the tensor decomposition or the computational complexity of the model. Focus on improving rendering quality by reducing artifacts, blurriness, or over-smoothing in rendered views while enhancing fine-grained details like textures or sharp object boundaries. At the same time, ensure the diversity of outputs by generating variations in lighting, material properties, or camera angles and by representing a broader variety of scenes or objects without increasing the tensor rank or model size. Consider methods like adaptive regularization to improve sharpness, feature augmentation to increase scene variations during training, and loss function refinements to enhance quality. All changes should maintain or reduce the model's memory footprint and computational complexity and be compatible with the current training pipeline. Include metrics to evaluate rendering quality, such as PSNR, SSIM, or LPIPS, and to assess diversity, such as entropy or feature diversity."
