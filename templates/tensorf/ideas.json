        "Experiment": "Modify the tensor decomposition pipeline to extract features at two key scales: coarse (global structure) and fine (local details). Integrate a multi-scale feature loss that compares these features between rendered and ground truth images. The loss function will combine traditional photometric loss (e.g., MSE) with the multi-scale feature loss, weighted to prioritize detail preservation. Evaluate rendering quality using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, and assess scene diversity using entropy and feature diversity metrics. This approach avoids external dependencies and leverages the existing model architecture for efficiency.",

Modify the loss function to combine the existing photometric loss (MSE) with the perceptual loss, using a fixed weight for the latter. Evaluate the approach using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, as well as qualitative comparisons of rendered images. The implementation will require adding a perceptual loss module and modifying the training loop to include the combined loss function.",
