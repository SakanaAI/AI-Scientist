['The method relies on manually tuned motion-specific bounds and hyperparameters (temperature, decay rate), which may introduce biases and limit its applicability to other motion types or domains.', 'Certain sections of the paper, particularly the experimental setup and the autoencoder aggregator, lack clarity, making it difficult to fully evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of the results.', 'The paper does not adequately address potential negative societal impacts or provide detailed qualitative analyses to support the quantitative results.', 'The novelty of the proposed approach may be limited as it builds on existing dynamic weighting techniques in a somewhat incremental manner.', 'The experimental results may not be generalizable due to the limited scope of motion types tested (only walking, jogging, and running).', 'The paper lacks a thorough comparison with a wider range of state-of-the-art methods in the field, limiting the understanding of its relative performance.']
