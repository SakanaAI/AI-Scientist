['The paper lacks sufficient details in the methodology section, particularly concerning the training process and the architecture of the discriminators.', 'The ablation studies, while useful, could be expanded to explore more variations and provide a deeper understanding of the proposed method.', 'The computational overhead and the need for manual tuning of window sizes are significant limitations that are not comprehensively addressed.', 'The novelty of hierarchical discriminators in adversarial learning is limited; the paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from existing work.', 'The choice of window sizes seems arbitrary, with no strong theoretical justification provided.', 'The paper is dense and difficult to follow in parts, especially in the description of the hierarchical discriminator architecture and the training process.', 'Jogging performance remains problematic, and the paper does not sufficiently address this issue.']
