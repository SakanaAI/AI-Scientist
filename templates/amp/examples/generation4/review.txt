['The scope is somewhat narrow, focusing primarily on locomotion tasks. It would be beneficial to extend the study to other types of motions or tasks.', 'The methodology section lacks sufficient detail, particularly in the description of the autoencoder aggregator and its role in the framework.', 'The evaluation metrics and their links to the research questions need to be more clearly defined.', 'The paper lacks a comprehensive ablation study to thoroughly investigate the impact of different components of the proposed approach.', 'The experiments are conducted within a specific framework and setup, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.', 'The training duration (10,000 steps) might not be sufficient to observe long-term effects.', 'More theoretical insights into why certain motions interfere with each other would strengthen the claims.']
