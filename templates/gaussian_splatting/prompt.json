Key to this\nperformance is a novel 3D Gaussian scene representation coupled with a real-time differentiable renderer, which offers significant speedup to both scene\noptimization and novel view synthesis. Note that for comparable training times to InstantNGP [Müller et al. 2022], we achieve similar quality to theirs; while\nthis is the maximum quality they reach, by training for 51min we achieve state-of-the-art quality, even slightly better than Mip-NeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022].\n\n\nMip-NeRF360 (0.071 fps)\nTrain: 48h, PSNR: 24.3\n\n\n**Ours (93 fps)**\nTrain: 51min, PSNR: 25.2\n\n\nPlenoxels (8.2 fps)\nTrain: 26min, PSNR: 21.9\n\n\nRadiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis\nof scenes captured with multiple photos or videos.

In contrast, recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) methods build on continuous scene representations, typically optimizing\na Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using volumetric ray-marching for\nnovel-view synthesis of captured scenes. Similarly, the most efficient\nradiance field solutions to date build on continuous representations\nby interpolating values stored in, e.g., voxel [Fridovich-Keil and Yu\net al. 2022] or hash [Müller et al. 2022] grids or points [Xu et al. 2022].\nWhile the continuous nature of these methods helps optimization,\nthe stochastic sampling required for rendering is costly and can\nresult in noise. We introduce a new approach that combines the best\nof both worlds: our 3D Gaussian representation allows optimization\nwith state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual quality and competitive training\ntimes, while our tile-based splatting solution ensures real-time rendering at SOTA quality for 1080p resolution on several previously\npublished datasets [Barron et al. 2022; Hedman et al. 2018; Knapitsch\net al. 2017] (see Fig. 1).\nOur goal is to allow real-time rendering for scenes captured with\nmultiple photos, and create the representations with optimization\ntimes as fast as the most efficient previous methods for typical\nreal scenes. Recent methods achieve fast training [Fridovich-Keil\n\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article . Publication date: August 2023.\n\n\n**Ours (135** fps)\nTrain: 6min, PSNR: 23.6\n\n\n-----\n\n2 - Bernhard Kerbl, Georgios Kopanas, Thomas Leimkühler, and George Drettakis\n\nand Yu et al. 2022; Müller et al. 2022], but struggle to achieve the\nvisual quality obtained by the current SOTA NeRF methods, i.e.,\nMip-NeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022], which requires up to 48 hours of\ntraining time. The fast – but lower-quality – radiance field methods\ncan achieve interactive rendering times depending on the scene\n(10-15 frames per second), but fall short of real-time rendering at\nhigh resolution.\nOur solution builds on three main components. We first introduce 3D Gaussians as a flexible and expressive scene representation.\nWe start with the same input as previous NeRF-like methods, i.e.,\ncameras calibrated with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) [Snavely et al.\n2006] and initialize the set of 3D Gaussians with the sparse point\ncloud produced for free as part of the SfM process. In contrast to\nmost point-based solutions that require Multi-View Stereo (MVS)\ndata [Aliev et al. 2020; Kopanas et al. 2021; Rückert et al. 2022], we\nachieve high-quality results with only SfM points as input. Note\nthat for the NeRF-synthetic dataset, our method achieves high quality even with random initialization. We show that 3D Gaussians\nare an excellent choice, since they are a differentiable volumetric\nrepresentation, but they can also be rasterized very efficiently by\nprojecting them to 2D, and applying standard 𝛼-blending, using an\nequivalent image formation model as NeRF. The second component\nof our method is optimization of the properties of the 3D Gaussians\n– 3D position, opacity 𝛼, anisotropic covariance, and spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients – interleaved with adaptive density control\nsteps, where we add and occasionally remove 3D Gaussians during\noptimization. The optimization procedure produces a reasonably\ncompact, unstructured, and precise representation of the scene (1-5\nmillion Gaussians for all scenes tested). The third and final element\nof our method is our real-time rendering solution that uses fast GPU\nsorting algorithms and is inspired by tile-based rasterization, following recent work [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021]. However, thanks\nto our 3D Gaussian representation, we can perform anisotropic\nsplatting that respects visibility ordering – thanks to sorting and 𝛼blending – and enable a fast and accurate backward pass by tracking\nthe traversal of as many sorted splats as required.\nTo summarize, we provide the following contributions:\n\nThe introduction of anisotropic 3D Gaussians as a high-quality,\n\n  unstructured representation of radiance fields.\nAn optimization method of 3D Gaussian properties, inter\n  leaved with adaptive density control that creates high-quality\nrepresentations for captured scenes.\nA fast, differentiable rendering approach for the GPU, which\n\n  is visibility-aware, allows anisotropic splatting and fast backpropagation to achieve high-quality novel view synthesis.\n\nOur results on previously published datasets show that we can optimize our 3D Gaussians from multi-view captures and achieve equal\nor better quality than the best quality previous implicit radiance\nfield approaches. We also can achieve training speeds and quality\nsimilar to the fastest methods and importantly provide the first\n_real-time rendering with high quality for novel-view synthesis._\n\n##### 2 RELATED WORK\n\nWe first briefly overview traditional reconstruction, then discuss\npoint-based rendering and radiance field work, discussing their\n\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article . Publication date: August 2023.\n\n\nsimilarity; radiance fields are a vast area, so we focus only on directly\nrelated work. For complete coverage of the field, please see the\nexcellent recent surveys [Tewari et al. 2022; Xie et al. 2022].\n\n##### 2.1 Traditional Scene Reconstruction and Rendering\n\nThe first novel-view synthesis approaches were based on light fields,\nfirst densely sampled [Gortler et al. 1996; Levoy and Hanrahan 1996]\nthen allowing unstructured capture [Buehler et al. 2001]. The advent\nof Structure-from-Motion (SfM) [Snavely et al. 2006] enabled an\nentire new domain where a collection of photos could be used to\nsynthesize novel views. SfM estimates a sparse point cloud during\ncamera calibration, that was initially used for simple visualization\nof 3D space. Subsequent multi-view stereo (MVS) produced impressive full 3D reconstruction algorithms over the years [Goesele\net al. 2007], enabling the development of several view synthesis\nalgorithms [Chaurasia et al. 2013; Eisemann et al. 2008; Hedman\net al. 2018; Kopanas et al. 2021]. All these methods re-project and\n_blend the input images into the novel view camera, and use the_\ngeometry to guide this re-projection. These methods produced excellent results in many cases, but typically cannot completely recover from unreconstructed regions, or from “over-reconstruction”,\nwhen MVS generates inexistent geometry. Recent neural rendering algorithms [Tewari et al. 2022] vastly reduce such artifacts and\navoid the overwhelming cost of storing all input images on the GPU,\noutperforming these methods on most fronts.\n\n##### 2.2 Neural Rendering and Radiance Fields\n\nDeep learning techniques were adopted early for novel-view synthesis [Flynn et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2016]; CNNs were used to estimate\nblending weights [Hedman et al. 2018], or for texture-space solutions\n\n[Riegler and Koltun 2020; Thies et al. 2019]. The use of MVS-based\ngeometry is a major drawback of most of these methods; in addition,\nthe use of CNNs for final rendering frequently results in temporal\nflickering.\nVolumetric representations for novel-view synthesis were initiated by Soft3D [Penner and Zhang 2017]; deep-learning techniques coupled with volumetric ray-marching were subsequently\nproposed [Henzler et al. 2019; Sitzmann et al. 2019] building on a continuous differentiable density field to represent geometry. Rendering\nusing volumetric ray-marching has a significant cost due to the large\nnumber of samples required to query the volume. Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] introduced importance sampling and positional encoding to improve quality, but used a large\nMulti-Layer Perceptron negatively affecting speed. The success of\nNeRF has resulted in an explosion of follow-up methods that address\nquality and speed, often by introducing regularization strategies; the\ncurrent state-of-the-art in image quality for novel-view synthesis is\nMip-NeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022]. While the rendering quality is\noutstanding, training and rendering times remain extremely high;\nwe are able to equal or in some cases surpass this quality while\nproviding fast training and real-time rendering.\nThe most recent methods have focused on faster training and/or\nrendering mostly by exploiting three design choices: the use of spatial data structures to store (neural) features that are subsequently\ninterpolated during volumetric ray-marching, different encodings,\n\n\n-----\n\nand MLP capacity. Such methods include different variants of space\ndiscretization [Chen et al. 2022b,a; Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022;\nGarbin et al. 2021; Hedman et al. 2021; Reiser et al. 2021; Takikawa\net al. 2021; Wu et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2021], codebooks [Takikawa\net al. 2022], and encodings such as hash tables [Müller et al. 2022],\nallowing the use of a smaller MLP or foregoing neural networks\ncompletely [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022; Sun et al. 2022].\nMost notable of these methods are InstantNGP [Müller et al. 2022]\nwhich uses a hash grid and an occupancy grid to accelerate computation and a smaller MLP to represent density and appearance; and\nPlenoxels [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022] that use a sparse voxel\ngrid to interpolate a continuous density field, and are able to forgo\nneural networks altogether. Both rely on Spherical Harmonics: the\nformer to represent directional effects directly, the latter to encode\nits inputs to the color network. While both provide outstanding\nresults, these methods can still struggle to represent empty space\neffectively, depending in part on the scene/capture type. In addition,\nimage quality is limited in large part by the choice of the structured\ngrids used for acceleration, and rendering speed is hindered by the\nneed to query many samples for a given ray-marching step. The unstructured, explicit GPU-friendly 3D Gaussians we use achieve faster\nrendering speed and better quality without neural components.\n\n##### 2.3 Point-Based Rendering and Radiance Fields\n\nPoint-based methods efficiently render disconnected and unstructured geometry samples (i.e., point clouds) [Gross and Pfister 2011].\nIn its simplest form, point sample rendering [Grossman and Dally\n1998] rasterizes an unstructured set of points with a fixed size, for\nwhich it may exploit natively supported point types of graphics APIs\n\n[Sainz and Pajarola 2004] or parallel software rasterization on the\nGPU [Laine and Karras 2011; Schütz et al. 2022]. While true to the\nunderlying data, point sample rendering suffers from holes, causes\naliasing, and is strictly discontinuous. Seminal work on high-quality\npoint-based rendering addresses these issues by “splatting” point\nprimitives with an extent larger than a pixel, e.g., circular or elliptic\ndiscs, ellipsoids, or surfels [Botsch et al. 2005; Pfister et al. 2000; Ren\net al. 2002; Zwicker et al. 2001b].\nThere has been recent interest in differentiable point-based rendering techniques [Wiles et al. 2020; Yifan et al. 2019]. Points have been\naugmented with neural features and rendered using a CNN [Aliev\net al. 2020; Rückert et al. 2022] resulting in fast or even real-time\nview synthesis; however they still depend on MVS for the initial\ngeometry, and as such inherit its artifacts, most notably over- or\nunder-reconstruction in hard cases such as featureless/shiny areas\nor thin structures.\nPoint-based 𝛼-blending and NeRF-style volumetric rendering\nshare essentially the same image formation model. Specifically, the\ncolor 𝐶 is given by volumetric rendering along a ray:\n\n\n3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering        - 3\n\nwhere samples of density 𝜎, transmittance 𝑇, and color c are taken\nalong the ray with intervals 𝛿𝑖 . This can be re-written as\n\n\n_𝐶_ =\n\n\n_𝑁_\n∑︁\n\n_𝑇𝑖𝛼𝑖_ c𝑖, (2)\n_𝑖=1_\n\n\nwith\n\n\n_𝛼𝑖_ = (1 − exp(−𝜎𝑖𝛿𝑖 )) and 𝑇𝑖 =\n\n\n�𝑖 −1\n\n(1 − _𝛼𝑖_ ).\n_𝑗=1_\n\n\nA typical neural point-based approach (e.g., [Kopanas et al. 2022,\n2021]) computes the color 𝐶 of a pixel by blending N ordered points\noverlapping the pixel:\n\n\n∑︁\n_𝐶_ = _𝑐𝑖𝛼𝑖_\n\n_𝑖_ ∈N\n\n\n�𝑖 −1\n\n(1 − _𝛼_ _𝑗_ ), (3)\n_𝑗=1_\n\n\nwhere c𝑖 is the color of each point and 𝛼𝑖 is given by evaluating a\n2D Gaussian with covariance Σ [Yifan et al. 2019] multiplied with a\nlearned per-point opacity.\nFrom Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, we can clearly see that the image formation\nmodel is the same. However, the rendering algorithm is very different. NeRFs are a continuous representation implicitly representing\nempty/occupied space; expensive random sampling is required to\nfind the samples in Eq. 2 with consequent noise and computational\nexpense. In contrast, points are an unstructured, discrete representation that is flexible enough to allow creation, destruction, and\ndisplacement of geometry similar to NeRF. This is achieved by optimizing opacity and positions, as shown by previous work [Kopanas\net al. 2021], while avoiding the shortcomings of a full volumetric\nrepresentation.\nPulsar [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021] achieves fast sphere rasterization which inspired our tile-based and sorting renderer. However,\ngiven the analysis above, we want to maintain (approximate) conventional 𝛼-blending on sorted splats to have the advantages of volumetric representations: Our rasterization respects visibility order\nin contrast to their order-independent method. In addition, we backpropagate gradients on all splats in a pixel and rasterize anisotropic\nsplats. These elements all contribute to the high visual quality of\nour results (see Sec. 7.3). In addition, previous methods mentioned\nabove also use CNNs for rendering, which results in temporal instability. Nonetheless, the rendering speed of Pulsar [Lassner and\nZollhofer 2021] and ADOP [Rückert et al. 2022] served as motivation\nto develop our fast rendering solution.\nWhile focusing on specular effects, the diffuse point-based rendering track of Neural Point Catacaustics [Kopanas et al. 2022]\novercomes this temporal instability by using an MLP, but still required MVS geometry as input. The most recent method [Zhang\net al. 2022] in this category does not require MVS, and also uses\nSH for directions; however, it can only handle scenes of one object\nand needs masks for initialization. While fast for small resolutions\nand low point counts, it is unclear how it can scale to scenes of\ntypical datasets [Barron et al. 2022; Hedman et al. 2018; Knapitsch\net al. 2017]. We use 3D Gaussians for a more flexible scene representation, avoiding the need for MVS geometry and achieving\nreal-time rendering thanks to our tile-based rendering algorithm\nfor the projected Gaussians.\n\nACM Trans.

They employ\npoint pruning and densification techniques during optimization, but\nuse volumetric ray-marching and cannot achieve real-time display\nrates.\nIn the domain of human performance capture, 3D Gaussians have\nbeen used to represent captured human bodies [Rhodin et al. 2015;\nStoll et al. 2011]; more recently they have been used with volumetric\nray-marching for vision tasks [Wang et al. 2023]. Neural volumetric\nprimitives have been proposed in a similar context [Lombardi et al.\n2021]. While these methods inspired the choice of 3D Gaussians as\nour scene representation, they focus on the specific case of reconstructing and rendering a single isolated object (a human body or\nface), resulting in scenes with small depth complexity. In contrast,\nour optimization of anisotropic covariance, our interleaved optimization/density control, and efficient depth sorting for rendering allow\nus to handle complete, complex scenes including background, both\nindoors and outdoors and with large depth complexity.\n\n##### 3 OVERVIEW\n\nThe input to our method is a set of images of a static scene, together\nwith the corresponding cameras calibrated by SfM [Schönberger\nand Frahm 2016] which produces a sparse point cloud as a sideeffect. From these points we create a set of 3D Gaussians (Sec. 4),\ndefined by a position (mean), covariance matrix and opacity 𝛼, that\nallows a very flexible optimization regime. This results in a reasonably compact representation of the 3D scene, in part because highly\nanisotropic volumetric splats can be used to represent fine structures\ncompactly. The directional appearance component (color) of the\nradiance field is represented via spherical harmonics (SH), following\nstandard practice [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022; Müller et al.\n2022]. Our algorithm proceeds to create the radiance field representation (Sec. 5) via a sequence of optimization steps of 3D Gaussian\nparameters, i.e., position, covariance, 𝛼 and SH coefficients interleaved with operations for adaptive control of the Gaussian density.\nThe key to the efficiency of our method is our tile-based rasterizer\n(Sec. 6) that allows 𝛼-blending of anisotropic splats, respecting visibility order thanks to fast sorting. Out fast rasterizer also includes\na fast backward pass by tracking accumulated 𝛼 values, without a\nlimit on the number of Gaussians that can receive gradients. The\noverview of our method is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\n##### 4 DIFFERENTIABLE 3D GAUSSIAN SPLATTING\n\nOur goal is to optimize a scene representation that allows highquality novel view synthesis, starting from a sparse set of (SfM)\npoints without normals. To do this, we need a primitive that inherits\nthe properties of differentiable volumetric representations, while\nat the same time being unstructured and explicit to allow very fast\nrendering. We choose 3D Gaussians, which are differentiable and\ncan be easily projected to 2D splats allowing fast 𝛼-blending for\nrendering.\nOur representation has similarities to previous methods that use\n2D points [Kopanas et al. 2021; Yifan et al. 2019] and assume each\npoint is a small planar circle with a normal. Given the extreme\nsparsity of SfM points it is very hard to estimate normals. Similarly,\n\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article . Publication date: August 2023.\n\n\noptimizing very noisy normals from such an estimation would be\nvery challenging. Instead, we model the geometry as a set of 3D\nGaussians that do not require normals. Our Gaussians are defined\nby a full 3D covariance matrix Σ defined in world space [Zwicker\net al. 2001a] centered at point (mean) 𝜇:\n\n_𝐺_ (𝑥) = 𝑒 [−] 2[1] [(][𝑥] [)][𝑇] [Σ][−][1] [(][𝑥] [)] (4)\n\n. This Gaussian is multiplied by 𝛼 in our blending process.\nHowever, we need to project our 3D Gaussians to 2D for rendering.\nZwicker et al. [2001a] demonstrate how to do this projection to\nimage space. Given a viewing transformation 𝑊 the covariance\nmatrix Σ[′] in camera coordinates is given as follows:\n\nΣ[′] = 𝐽𝑊 Σ 𝑊 _[𝑇]_ _𝐽[𝑇]_ (5)\n\nwhere 𝐽 is the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projective\ntransformation. Zwicker et al. [2001a] also show that if we skip the\nthird row and column of Σ[′], we obtain a 2×2 variance matrix with\nthe same structure and properties as if we would start from planar\npoints with normals, as in previous work [Kopanas et al. 2021].\nAn obvious approach would be to directly optimize the covariance\nmatrix Σ to obtain 3D Gaussians that represent the radiance field.\nHowever, covariance matrices have physical meaning only when\nthey are positive semi-definite. For our optimization of all our parameters, we use gradient descent that cannot be easily constrained\nto produce such valid matrices, and update steps and gradients can\nvery easily create invalid covariance matrices.\nAs a result, we opted for a more intuitive, yet equivalently expressive representation for optimization. The covariance matrix Σ\nof a 3D Gaussian is analogous to describing the configuration of an\nellipsoid. Given a scaling matrix 𝑆 and rotation matrix 𝑅, we can\nfind the corresponding Σ:\n\nΣ = 𝑅𝑆𝑆[𝑇] _𝑅[𝑇]_ (6)\n\nTo allow independent optimization of both factors, we store them\nseparately: a 3D vector 𝑠 for scaling and a quaternion 𝑞 to represent\nrotation. These can be trivially converted to their respective matrices\nand combined, making sure to normalize 𝑞 to obtain a valid unit\nquaternion.\nTo avoid significant overhead due to automatic differentiation\nduring training, we derive the gradients for all parameters explicitly.\nDetails of the exact derivative computations are in appendix A.\nThis representation of anisotropic covariance – suitable for optimization – allows us to optimize 3D Gaussians to adapt to the\ngeometry of different shapes in captured scenes, resulting in a fairly\ncompact representation. Fig. 3 illustrates such cases.\n\n##### 5 OPTIMIZATION WITH ADAPTIVE DENSITY CONTROL OF 3D GAUSSIANS\n\nThe core of our approach is the optimization step, which creates\na dense set of 3D Gaussians accurately representing the scene for\nfree-view synthesis. In addition to positions 𝑝, 𝛼, and covariance\nΣ, we also optimize SH coefficients representing color 𝑐 of each\nGaussian to correctly capture the view-dependent appearance of\nthe scene. The optimization of these parameters is interleaved with\nsteps that control the density of the Gaussians to better represent\nthe scene.\n\n\n-----\n\n3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering - 5\n\n\nCamera\n\n\nProjection\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nDifferentiable\nTile Rasterizer\n\n\nImage\n\n\nSfM Points **3D Gaussians**\n\n\nAdaptive\nDensity Control\n\n\nFig. 2. Optimization starts with the sparse SfM point cloud and creates a set of 3D Gaussians. We then optimize and adaptively control the density of this set\nof Gaussians. During optimization we use our fast tile-based renderer, allowing competitive training times compared to SOTA fast radiance field methods.\nOnce trained, our renderer allows real-time navigation for a wide variety of scenes.\n\nWe use 휆 = 0.2 in all our tests. We provide details of the learning\nschedule and other elements in Sec. 7.1.\n\n##### 5.2 Adaptive Control of Gaussians\n\n\nShrunken\nOriginal\nGaussians\n\n\nFig. 3. We visualize the 3D Gaussians after optimization by shrinking them\n60% (far right). This clearly shows the anisotropic shapes of the 3D Gaussians\nthat compactly represent complex geometry after optimization. Left the\nactual rendered image.\n\n##### 5.1 Optimization\n\nThe optimization is based on successive iterations of rendering and\ncomparing the resulting image to the training views in the captured\ndataset. Inevitably, geometry may be incorrectly placed due to the\nambiguities of 3D to 2D projection. Our optimization thus needs to\nbe able to create geometry and also destroy or move geometry if it\nhas been incorrectly positioned. The quality of the parameters of the\ncovariances of the 3D Gaussians is critical for the compactness of\nthe representation since large homogeneous areas can be captured\nwith a small number of large anisotropic Gaussians.\nWe use Stochastic Gradient Descent techniques for optimization,\ntaking full advantage of standard GPU-accelerated frameworks,\nand the ability to add custom CUDA kernels for some operations,\nfollowing recent best practice [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022;\nSun et al. 2022]. In particular, our fast rasterization (see Sec. 6) is\ncritical in the efficiency of our optimization, since it is the main\ncomputational bottleneck of the optimization.\nWe use a sigmoid activation function for 훼 to constrain it in\nthe 0 1 range and obtain smooth gradients, and an exponential\n[ − )\nactivation function for the scale of the covariance for similar reasons.\nWe estimate the initial covariance matrix as an isotropic Gaussian\nwith axes equal to the mean of the distance to the closest three points.\nWe use a standard exponential decay scheduling technique similar\nto Plenoxels [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022], but for positions\nonly. The loss function is L1 combined with a D-SSIM term:\n\nL = (1 − _휆)L1 + 휆LD-SSIM_ (7)\n\n\nWe start with the initial set of sparse points from SfM and then apply\nour method to adaptively control the number of Gaussians and their\ndensity over unit volume[1], allowing us to go from an initial sparse\nset of Gaussians to a denser set that better represents the scene, and\nwith correct parameters. After optimization warm-up (see Sec. 7.1),\nwe densify every 100 iterations and remove any Gaussians that are\nessentially transparent, i.e., with 훼 less than a threshold 휖훼 .\nOur adaptive control of the Gaussians needs to populate empty\nareas. It focuses on regions with missing geometric features (“underreconstruction”), but also in regions where Gaussians cover large\nareas in the scene (which often correspond to “over-reconstruction”).\nWe observe that both have large view-space positional gradients.\nIntuitively, this is likely because they correspond to regions that are\nnot yet well reconstructed, and the optimization tries to move the\nGaussians to correct this.\nSince both cases are good candidates for densification, we densify Gaussians with an average magnitude of view-space position\ngradients above a threshold 휏pos, which we set to 0.0002 in our tests.\nWe next present details of this process, illustrated in Fig. 4.\nFor small Gaussians that are in under-reconstructed regions, we\nneed to cover the new geometry that must be created. For this, it is\npreferable to clone the Gaussians, by simply creating a copy of the\nsame size, and moving it in the direction of the positional gradient.\nOn the other hand, large Gaussians in regions with high variance\nneed to be split into smaller Gaussians. We replace such Gaussians\nby two new ones, and divide their scale by a factor of 휙 = 1.6 which\nwe determined experimentally. We also initialize their position by\nusing the original 3D Gaussian as a PDF for sampling.\nIn the first case we detect and treat the need for increasing both\nthe total volume of the system and the number of Gaussians, while\nin the second case we conserve total volume but increase the number of Gaussians. Similar to other volumetric representations, our\noptimization can get stuck with floaters close to the input cameras;\nin our case this may result in an unjustified increase in the Gaussian\ndensity. An effective way to moderate the increase in the number\nof Gaussians is to set the 훼 value close to zero every 푁 = 3000\n\n1Density of Gaussians should not be confused of course with density 휎 in the NeRF\nliterature.\n\nACM Trans.

The optimization then increases the 훼 for the Gaussians\nwhere this is needed while allowing our culling approach to remove\nGaussians with 훼 less than 휖훼 as described above. Gaussians may\nshrink or grow and considerably overlap with others, but we periodically remove Gaussians that are very large in worldspace and\nthose that have a big footprint in viewspace. This strategy results\nin overall good control over the total number of Gaussians. The\nGaussians in our model remain primitives in Euclidean space at all\ntimes; unlike other methods [Barron et al. 2022; Fridovich-Keil and\nYu et al. 2022], we do not require space compaction, warping or\nprojection strategies for distant or large Gaussians.\n\n##### 6 FAST DIFFERENTIABLE RASTERIZER FOR GAUSSIANS\n\nOur goals are to have fast overall rendering and fast sorting to allow\napproximate 훼-blending – including for anisotropic splats – and to\navoid hard limits on the number of splats that can receive gradients\nthat exist in previous work [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021].\nTo achieve these goals, we design a tile-based rasterizer for Gaussian splats inspired by recent software rasterization approaches [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021] to pre-sort primitives for an entire image\nat a time, avoiding the expense of sorting per pixel that hindered\nprevious 훼-blending solutions [Kopanas et al. 2022, 2021]. Our fast\nrasterizer allows efficient backpropagation over an arbitrary number of blended Gaussians with low additional memory consumption, requiring only a constant overhead per pixel. Our rasterization\npipeline is fully differentiable, and given the projection to 2D (Sec. 4)\ncan rasterize anisotropic splats similar to previous 2D splatting\nmethods [Kopanas et al. 2021].\nOur method starts by splitting the screen into 16 16 tiles, and\n×\nthen proceeds to cull 3D Gaussians against the view frustum and\neach tile. Specifically, we only keep Gaussians with a 99% confidence interval intersecting the view frustum. Additionally, we use a\nguard band to trivially reject Gaussians at extreme positions (i.e.,\nthose with means close to the near plane and far outside the view\nfrustum), since computing their projected 2D covariance would\nbe unstable. We then instantiate each Gaussian according to the\n\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article . Publication date: August 2023.\n\n\nnumber of tiles they overlap and assign each instance a key that\ncombines view space depth and tile ID. We then sort Gaussians\nbased on these keys using a single fast GPU Radix sort [Merrill\nand Grimshaw 2010]. Note that there is no additional per-pixel ordering of points, and blending is performed based on this initial\nsorting. As a consequence, our 훼-blending can be approximate in\nsome configurations. However, these approximations become negligible as splats approach the size of individual pixels. We found that\nthis choice greatly enhances training and rendering performance\nwithout producing visible artifacts in converged scenes.\nAfter sorting Gaussians, we produce a list for each tile by identifying the first and last depth-sorted entry that splats to a given\ntile. For rasterization, we launch one thread block for each tile. Each\nblock first collaboratively loads packets of Gaussians into shared\nmemory and then, for a given pixel, accumulates color and 훼 values\nby traversing the lists front-to-back, thus maximizing the gain in\nparallelism both for data loading/sharing and processing. When we\nreach a target saturation of 훼 in a pixel, the corresponding thread\nstops. At regular intervals, threads in a tile are queried and the processing of the entire tile terminates when all pixels have saturated\n(i.e., 훼 goes to 1). Details of sorting and a high-level overview of the\noverall rasterization approach are given in Appendix C.\nDuring rasterization, the saturation of 훼 is the only stopping criterion. In contrast to previous work, we do not limit the number\nof blended primitives that receive gradient updates. We enforce\nthis property to allow our approach to handle scenes with an arbitrary, varying depth complexity and accurately learn them, without\nhaving to resort to scene-specific hyperparameter tuning. During\nthe backward pass, we must therefore recover the full sequence of\nblended points per-pixel in the forward pass. One solution would\nbe to store arbitrarily long lists of blended points per-pixel in global\nmemory [Kopanas et al. 2021]. To avoid the implied dynamic memory management overhead, we instead choose to traverse the pertile lists again; we can reuse the sorted array of Gaussians and tile\nranges from the forward pass. To facilitate gradient computation,\nwe now traverse them back-to-front.\nThe traversal starts from the last point that affected any pixel in\nthe tile, and loading of points into shared memory again happens\ncollaboratively. Additionally, each pixel will only start (expensive)\noverlap testing and processing of points if their depth is lower than\nor equal to the depth of the last point that contributed to its color\nduring the forward pass. Computation of the gradients described in\nSec. 4 requires the accumulated opacity values at each step during\nthe original blending process. Rather than trasversing an explicit\nlist of progressively shrinking opacities in the backward pass, we\ncan recover these intermediate opacities by storing only the total\naccumulated opacity at the end of the forward pass. Specifically, each\npoint stores the final accumulated opacity 훼 in the forward process;\nwe divide this by each point’s 훼 in our back-to-front traversal to\nobtain the required coefficients for gradient computation.\n\n##### 7 IMPLEMENTATION, RESULTS AND EVALUATION\n\nWe next discuss some details of implementation, present results and\nthe evaluation of our algorithm compared to previous work and\nablation studies.\n\n\nSplitSplitSplit\n\n\n-----\n\n3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering                                                     - 7\n\nGround Truth Ours Mip-NeRF360 InstantNGP Plenoxels\n\nFig. 5.

At 30K iterations (∼35min) the background artifacts have been reduced significantly. For\nother scenes (below), the difference is barely visible; 7K iterations (∼8min)\nis already very high quality.\n\nTable 2.

We also built an interactive viewer using\nthe open-source SIBR [Bonopera et al. 2020], used for interactive\nviewing. We used this implementation to measure our achieved\nframe rates. The source code and all our data are available at:\n[https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/)\n\n_Optimization Details. For stability, we “warm-up” the computa-_\ntion in lower resolution. Specifically, we start the optimization using\n4 times smaller image resolution and we upsample twice after 250\nand 500 iterations.\nSH coefficient optimization is sensitive to the lack of angular\ninformation.

We tested our algorithm on a total of 13 real scenes_\ntaken from previously published datasets and the synthetic Blender\ndataset [Mildenhall et al. 2020]. In particular, we tested our approach on the full set of scenes presented in Mip-Nerf360 [Barron\net al. 2022], which is the current state of the art in NeRF rendering\nquality, two scenes from the Tanks&Temples dataset [2017] and\ntwo scenes provided by Hedman et al. [Hedman et al. 2018]. The\nscenes we chose have very different capture styles, and cover both\nbounded indoor scenes and large unbounded outdoor environments.\nWe use the same hyperparameter configuration for all experiments\nin our evaluation. All results are reported running on an A6000 GPU,\nexcept for the Mip-NeRF360 method (see below).\nIn supplemental, we show a rendered video path for a selection\nof scenes that contain views far from the input photos.\n\n_Real-World Scenes. In terms of quality, the current state-of-the-_\nart is Mip-Nerf360 [Barron et al. 2021]. We compare against this\nmethod as a quality benchmark. We also compare against two of\nthe most recent fast NeRF methods: InstantNGP [Müller et al. 2022]\nand Plenoxels [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022].\nWe use a train/test split for datasets, using the methodology\nsuggested by Mip-NeRF360, taking every 8th photo for test, for consistent and meaningful comparisons to generate the error metrics,\nusing the standard PSNR, L-PIPS, and SSIM metrics used most frequently in the literature; please see Table 1. All numbers in the table\nare from our own runs of the author’s code for all previous methods, except for those of Mip-NeRF360 on their dataset, in which we\ncopied the numbers from the original publication to avoid confusion\nabout the current SOTA. For the images in our figures, we used our\nown run of Mip-NeRF360: the numbers for these runs are in Appendix D. We also show the average training time, rendering speed, and\nmemory used to store optimized parameters. We report results for a\nbasic configuration of InstantNGP (Base) that run for 35K iterations\nas well as a slightly larger network suggested by the authors (Big),\nand two configurations, 7K and 30K iterations for ours. We show\n\n\n#### 7K iterations\n\n\n-----\n\n3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering                                                     - 9\n\nTable 3. PSNR Score for ablation runs. For this experiment, we manually downsampled high-resolution versions of each scene’s input images to the established\nrendering resolution of our other experiments. Doing so reduces random artifacts (e.g., due to JPEG compression in the pre-downscaled Mip-NeRF360 inputs).\n\n\nthe difference in visual quality for our two configurations in Fig. 6.\nIn many cases, quality at 7K iterations is already quite good.\nThe training times vary over datasets and we report them separately. Note that image resolutions also vary over datasets. In the\nproject website, we provide all the renders of test views we used to\ncompute the statistics for all the methods (ours and previous work)\non all scenes. Note that we kept the native input resolution for all\nrenders.\nThe table shows that our fully converged model achieves quality that is on par and sometimes slightly better than the SOTA\nMip-NeRF360 method; note that on the same hardware, their average training time was 48 hours[2], compared to our 35-45min, and\ntheir rendering time is 10s/frame. We achieve comparable quality\nto InstantNGP and Plenoxels after 5-10m of training, but additional\ntraining time allows us to achieve SOTA quality which is not the\ncase for the other fast methods. For Tanks & Temples, we achieve\nsimilar quality as the basic InstantNGP at a similar training time\n( 7min in our case).\n∼\nWe also show visual results of this comparison for a left-out\ntest view for ours and the previous rendering methods selected\nfor comparison in Fig. 5; the results of our method are for 30K\niterations of training. We see that in some cases even Mip-NeRF360\nhas remaining artifacts that our method avoids (e.g., blurriness in\nvegetation – in Bicycle, Stump – or on the walls in Room). In the\nsupplemental video and web page we provide comparisons of paths\nfrom a distance. Our method tends to preserve visual detail of wellcovered regions even from far away, which is not always the case\nfor previous methods.\n\n_Synthetic Bounded Scenes. In addition to realistic scenes, we also_\nevaluate our approach on the synthetic Blender dataset [Mildenhall\net al. 2020]. The scenes in question provide an exhaustive set of\nviews, are limited in size, and provide exact camera parameters. In\nsuch scenarios, we can achieve state-of-the-art results even with\nrandom initialization: we start training from 100K uniformly random\nGaussians inside a volume that encloses the scene bounds. Our\napproach quickly and automatically prunes them to about 6–10K\nmeaningful Gaussians. The final size of the trained model after 30K\niterations reaches about 200–500K Gaussians per scene. We report\nand compare our achieved PSNR scores with previous methods in\nTable 2 using a white background for compatibility. Examples can\n\n2We trained Mip-NeRF360 on a 4-GPU A100 node for 12 hours, equivalent to 48 hours\non a single GPU.

In comparison to previous explicit scene representa-_\ntions, the anisotropic Gaussians used in our optimization are capable\nof modelling complex shapes with a lower number of parameters.\nWe showcase this by evaluating our approach against the highly\ncompact, point-based models obtained by [Zhang et al. 2022]. We\nstart from their initial point cloud which is obtained by space carving\nwith foreground masks and optimize until we break even with their\nreported PSNR scores. This usually happens within 2–4 minutes.\nWe surpass their reported metrics using approximately one-fourth\nof their point count, resulting in an average model size of 3.8 MB,\nas opposed to their 9 MB. We note that for this experiment, we only\nused two degrees of our spherical harmonics, similar to theirs.\n\n##### 7.3 Ablations\n\nWe isolated the different contributions and algorithmic choices\nwe made and constructed a set of experiments to measure their\neffect. Specifically we test the following aspects of our algorithm:\ninitialization from SfM, our densification strategies, anisotropic\ncovariance, the fact that we allow an unlimited number of splats\nto have gradients and use of spherical harmonics. The quantitative\neffect of each choice is summarized in Table 3.\n\n_Initialization from SfM. We also assess the importance of initializ-_\ning the 3D Gaussians from the SfM point cloud. For this ablation, we\nuniformly sample a cube with a size equal to three times the extent\nof the input camera’s bounding box. We observe that our method\nperforms relatively well, avoiding complete failure even without the\nSfM points. Instead, it degrades mainly in the background, see Fig. 7.\nAlso in areas not well covered from training views, the random\ninitialization method appears to have more floaters that cannot be\nremoved by optimization. On the other hand, the synthetic NeRF\ndataset does not have this behavior because it has no background\nand is well constrained by the input cameras (see discussion above).\n\n_Densification. We next evaluate our two densification methods,_\nmore specifically the clone and split strategy described in Sec. 5.\nWe disable each method separately and optimize using the rest of\nthe method unchanged. Results show that splitting big Gaussians\nis important to allow good reconstruction of the background as\nseen in Fig. 8, while cloning the small Gaussians instead of splitting\nthem allows for a better and faster convergence especially when\nthin structures appear in the scene.\n\nACM Trans.

Left: limit of 10 Gaussians that receive gradients.\nRight: our full method.\n\nwill give us speed without sacrificing quality, as suggested in Pulsar [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021]. In this test, we choose N=10, which\nis two times higher than the default value in Pulsar, but it led to\nunstable optimization because of the severe approximation in the\ngradient computation. For the Truck scene, quality degraded by\n11dB in PSNR (see Table 3, Limited-BW), and the visual outcome is\nshown in Fig. 9 for Garden.\n\n_Anisotropic Covariance. An important algorithmic choice in our_\nmethod is the optimization of the full covariance matrix for the 3D\nGaussians. To demonstrate the effect of this choice, we perform an\nablation where we remove anisotropy by optimizing a single scalar\nvalue that controls the radius of the 3D Gaussian on all three axes.\nThe results of this optimization are presented visually in Fig. 10.\nWe observe that the anisotropy significantly improves the quality\nof the 3D Gaussian’s ability to align with surfaces, which in turn\nallows for much higher rendering quality while maintaining the\nsame number of points.\n\n_Spherical Harmonics. Finally, the use of spherical harmonics im-_\nproves our overall PSNR scores since they compensate for the viewdependent effects (Table 3).\n\n##### 7.4 Limitations\n\nOur method is not without limitations. In regions where the scene\nis not well observed we have artifacts; in such regions, other methods also struggle (e.g., Mip-NeRF360 in Fig. 11). Even though the\nanisotropic Gaussians have many advantages as described above,\nour method can create elongated artifacts or “splotchy” Gaussians\n(see Fig. 12); again previous methods also struggle in these cases.\nWe also occasionally have popping artifacts when our optimization creates large Gaussians; this tends to happen in regions with\nview-dependent appearance. One reason for these popping artifacts\nis the trivial rejection of Gaussians via a guard band in the rasterizer.\nA more principled culling approach would alleviate these artifacts.\nAnother factor is our simple visibility algorithm, which can lead to\nGaussians suddenly switching depth/blending order. This could be\naddressed by antialiasing, which we leave as future work. Also, we\ncurrently do not apply any regularization to our optimization; doing\nso would help with both the unseen region and popping artifacts.\nWhile we used the same hyperparameters for our full evaluation,\nearly experiments show that reducing the position learning rate can\nbe necessary to converge in very large scenes (e.g., urban datasets).\n\n\nNo Clone-5k\n\n\nSfM\n\n\nRandom\n\n\n-----\n\n3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering - 11\n\n\n### Ground Ground Ground\n Full Isotropic Full Isotropic Full Isotropic Truth Truth Truth\n\nFig. 10.

During training of large scenes, peak\nGPU memory consumption can exceed 20 GB in our unoptimized\nprototype. However, this figure could be significantly reduced by a\ncareful low-level implementation of the optimization logic (similar\nto InstantNGP). Rendering the trained scene requires sufficient GPU\nmemory to store the full model (several hundred megabytes for\nlarge-scale scenes) and an additional 30–500 MB for the rasterizer,\ndepending on scene size and image resolution. We note that there\nare many opportunities to further reduce memory consumption\nof our method. Compression techniques for point clouds is a wellstudied field [De Queiroz and Chou 2016]; it would be interesting to\nsee how such approaches could be adapted to our representation.\n\nFig. 11.

Our work demonstrates that – contrary to\nwidely accepted opinion – a continuous representation is not strictly\nnecessary to allow fast and high-quality radiance field training.\nThe majority ( 80%) of our training time is spent in Python code,\n∼\nsince we built our solution in PyTorch to allow our method to be\neasily used by others. Only the rasterization routine is implemented\nas optimized CUDA kernels. We expect that porting the remaining\noptimization entirely to CUDA, as e.g., done in InstantNGP [Müller\net al. 2022], could enable significant further speedup for applications\nwhere performance is essential.\nWe also demonstrated the importance of building on real-time\nrendering principles, exploiting the power of the GPU and speed of\nsoftware rasterization pipeline architecture. These design choices\nare the key to performance both for training and real-time rendering, providing a competitive edge in performance over previous\nvolumetric ray-marching.\nIt would be interesting to see if our Gaussians can be used to perform mesh reconstructions of the captured scene. Aside from practical implications given the widespread use of meshes, this would\nallow us to better understand where our method stands exactly in\nthe continuum between volumetric and surface representations.\nIn conclusion, we have presented the first real-time rendering\nsolution for radiance fields, with rendering quality that matches the\nbest expensive previous methods, with training times competitive\nwith the fastest existing solutions.\n\n##### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was funded by the ERC Advanced grant FUNGRAPH\n[No 788065 http://fungraph.inria.fr.

Our design is based on the assumption of a high load_\nof small splats, and we optimize for this by sorting splats once for\neach frame using radix sort at the beginning. We split the screen\ninto 16x16 pixel tiles (or bins). We create a list of splats per tile by\ninstantiating each splat in each 16 16 tile it overlaps. This results\n×\nin a moderate increase in Gaussians to process which however is\namortized by simpler control flow and high parallelism of optimized\nGPU Radix sort [Merrill and Grimshaw 2010]. We assign a key for\neach splats instance with up to 64 bits where the lower 32 bits\nencode its projected depth and the higher bits encode the index of\nthe overlapped tile. The exact size of the index depends on how\nmany tiles fit the current resolution. Depth ordering is thus directly\nresolved for all splats in parallel with a single radix sort. After\n\nACM Trans.

Publication date: August 2023.\n\n\n-----\n\n14 - Bernhard Kerbl, Georgios Kopanas, Thomas Leimkühler, and George Drettakis\n\nsorting, we can efficiently produce per-tile lists of Gaussians to\nprocess by identifying the start and end of ranges in the sorted\narray with the same tile ID. This is done in parallel, launching\none thread per 64-bit array element to compare its higher 32 bits\nwith its two neighbors. Compared to [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021],\nour rasterization thus completely eliminates sequential primitive\nprocessing steps and produces more compact per-tile lists to traverse\nduring the forward pass.

During the backward pass, we reconstruct_\nthe intermediate opacity values needed for gradient computation by\nrepeatedly dividing the accumulated opacity from the forward pass\nby each Gaussian’s 𝛼. Implemented naïvely, this process is prone to\nnumerical instabilities (e.g., division by 0). To address this, both in\nthe forward and backward pass, we skip any blending updates with\n_𝛼_ _< 𝜖_ (we choose 𝜖 as 2551 [) and also clamp][ 𝛼] [with 0][.][99 from above.]\n\nFinally, before a Gaussian is included in the forward rasterization\npass, we compute the accumulated opacity if we were to include it\nand stop front-to-back blending before it can exceed 0.9999.\n\n##### D PER-SCENE ERROR METRICS\n\nTables 4–9 list the various collected error metrics for our evaluation\nover all considered techniques and real-world scenes. We list both\nthe copied Mip-NeRF360 numbers and those of our runs used to\ngenerate the images in the paper; averages for these over the full\nMip-NeRF360 dataset are PSNR 27.58, SSIM 0.790, and LPIPS 0.240.\n\nACM Trans.
