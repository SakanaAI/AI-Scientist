        "Experiment": "In this experiment, we train MACE model on each of the 10 datasets stored in folders with the corresponding molecule names ('ethanol', 'benzene', 'uracil','naphthalene','aspirin','salicylic','malonaldehyde','toluene','paracetamol','azobenzene'), and run molecular dynamics simulaions for each of them to estimate stability of the molecule's MD trajectory via RMSF of the trajectory. Our goal is to check whether there is a overall improvement of the stability of the trajectories accross different molecules with the change of the number of interactions passed as a parameter to MACE model. We try to account to the fact that difference in validation metrics for the trained MACE models may explain the possible differences in stability of MD trajectories to some extent as well.",

        "Experiment": "We will modify the training function to test three specific hidden irreps configurations for each max_L value (1-3): (1) minimal: 'max_L*64x0e + max_L*64x1o', (2) balanced: 'max_L*128x0e + max_L*128x1o', and (3) rich: 'max_L*256x0e + max_L*256x1o'. For each combination, we will track both validation MAE and MD trajectory stability (RMFS). The analysis will focus on identifying whether larger molecules benefit more from richer representations, and whether there's a correlation between validation performance and MD stability. Results will be used to formulate practical guidelines for choosing these parameters based on molecular size and complexity.",

        "Experiment": "Modify the run_md function to perform simulations at two distinct temperatures (150K and 450K) for each molecule. Calculate both RMFS and energy fluctuations at each temperature. Compare the ratio of high-temp to low-temp RMFS with the theoretical \u221aT scaling (should be \u221a(450/150) \u2248 1.73). Also compute energy fluctuations per degree of freedom to verify they follow kT/2. Store these metrics alongside validation errors to assess if deviations from expected behavior correlate with model accuracy. This requires adding a temperature loop in main execution and extending results storage to include temperature-dependent metrics.",
