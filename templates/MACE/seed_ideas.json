    "Experiment": "In this experiment, we train MACE model on each of the 10 datasets stored in folders with the corresponding molecule names ('ethanol', 'benzene', 'uracil','naphthalene','aspirin','salicylic','malonaldehyde','toluene','paracetamol','azobenzene'), and run molecular dynamics simulaions for each of them to estimate stability of the molecule's MD trajectory via RMSF of the trajectory. Our goal is to check whether there is a overall improvement of the stability of the trajectories accross different molecules with the change of the number of interactions passed as a parameter to MACE model. We try to account to the fact that difference in validation metrics for the trained MACE models may explain the possible differences in stability of MD trajectories to some extent as well.",
