ABSTRACT

We address the problem of safely solving complex bimanual robot manipulation
tasks with sparse rewards. Such challenging tasks can be decomposed into subtasks that are accomplishable by different robots concurrently or sequentially for
better efficiency. While previous reinforcement learning approaches primarily
focus on modeling the compositionality of sub-tasks, two fundamental issues are
largely ignored particularly when learning cooperative strategies for two robots:
(i) domination, i.e., one robot may try to solve a task by itself and leaves the
other idle; (ii) conflict, i.e., one robot can interrupt another’s workspace when
executing different sub-tasks simultaneously, which leads to unsafe collisions. To
tackle these two issues, we propose a novel technique called disentangled attention,
which provides an intrinsic regularization for two robots to focus on separate subtasks and objects. We evaluate our method on five bimanual manipulation tasks.
Experimental results show that our proposed intrinsic regularization successfully
avoids domination and reduces conflicts for the policies, which leads to significantly
more efficient and safer cooperative strategies than all the baselines. Our project

1 INTRODUCTION

Consider the bimanual robot manipulation tasks such as rearranging multiple objects to their target
locations in Figure 1 (a). This complex and compositional task is very challenging as the agents will
first need to reduce it to several sub-tasks (pushing or grasping each object), and then the two agents
will need to figure out how to allocate each sub-task to each other (which object each robot should
operate on) for better collaboration. Importantly, two robots should avoid collision in a narrow space
for safety concerns. While training a single RL agent that can solve such compositional tasks has
caught research attention recently (Chang et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019; Devin et al., 2019; Jiang
et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; 2020), there are still two main challenges that are barely touched when
it comes to tackle bimanual manipulation: (i) domination, i.e., one robot may tend to solve all the
sub-tasks while the other robot remains idle, which hurts the task solving efficiency; (ii) conflict, i.e.,
two robots may try to solve the same sub-task simultaneously, which result in unsafe conflicts and
interruptions on shared workspace.

One possible solution is to design a task-allocation reward function to encourage better coordination.
However, it is particularly non-trivial and often sub-optimal to manually design such a reward function
for complex problems that contain a large continuous sub-task space, such as the rearrangement task
in Figure 1 (a). Moreover, even with the reward function described above in hand, it remains unclear
how to reduce collisions, particularly for the tasks that require two robots to act simultaneously and
safely. For example, in the task shown in Figure 1 (d), one robot needs to push the green door to
make space for the other robot to move the blue box to the goal position. However, these two robots
can easily interrupt and collide with each other when they perform these coordination actions.

We consider an alternative setting using sparse rewards without explicitly assigning sub-tasks to
the robots. However, this leads to another challenge: How to encourage the robots to explore
collaborative and safe behaviors with limited positive feedbacks? For bimanual manipulation, an
intrinsic motivation is introduced by Chitnis et al. (2020b), leveraging the difference between the

actual effect of an action (taken by two robots) and the composition of individual predicted effect
from each agent using a forward model. While this intrinsic reward encourages the two robots to
collaborate for tasks that are hard to achieve by a single robot, it does not address the domination and
_conflict problems for efficient and safe manipulation._

In this paper, we present DAIR: Disentangled Attention Intrinsic Regularization which encourages the
two robots to safely and efficiently collaborate on different sub-tasks during bimanual manipulation.
Instead of designing a new intrinsic reward function, we introduce a simple regularization term
for representation learning, which encourages the robots to attend to different interaction regions.
Specifically, we adopt the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) in both our policy and value
networks, where we compute the dot-product between each robot representation and the object
interaction region representations to obtain a probability distribution. Each robot has its own
probability distribution to represent which interaction region it is focusing on. We define our
intrinsic regularization as minimizing the dot product between the two probability distributions
between two robots (i.e., to be orthogonal) in each time step. By adding this loss function, different
robots will be regularized to attend to different interaction points within their policy representation.
This forces the policies to tackle sub-tasks over disjoint working space without interfering with each
other. We remark that disentangled attention can be generalized to environments with multiple agents.

In our experiments, we focus on five diverse manipulation tasks in simulation environments with two
Fetch robots as shown in Figure 1. These tasks not only require the robots to manipulate multiple
objects (more than two, up to eight) with each object offering one interaction region, but also a single
heavy object with multiple interaction regions (Figure 1 (e)). In our experiments, we show that our
approach not only improves performance and sample efficiency in learning, but also helps avoiding
the domination problem and largely reducing the conflicts for safe coordination between two robots.
Moreover, the learned policies can also solve the task in fewer steps, which is the significance of
bimanual cooperation compared to single-arm manipulation. We highlight our main contributions as:

-  Observation for two important problems (domination and conflict) in training RL agents for
safe bimanual manipulation, and a new robotics task set with one to eight objects.

-  We propose DAIR, a novel and general intrinsic regularization. It not only improves the
success rate in bimanual manipulation, solves the tasks more efficiently, but also reduces the
conflicts between robots. This allows the robots to collaborate and coordinate more safely.

2 RELATED WORK

**Intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning. To train RL agents with sparse rewards, Schmid-**
huber (1991) first proposed to motivate the agent to reach state space giving a large model prediction
error, which indicates the state is currently unexplored and unseen by the model. Such a mechanism
is also called intrinsic motivation, which provides a reward for agents to explore what makes it
curious (Oudeyer et al., 2007; Barto, 2013; Bellemare et al., 2016; Ostrovski et al., 2017; Huang
et al., 2019). Recently, it has also been shown that the agents can explore with such an intrinsic
motivation without extrinsic rewards (Pathak et al., 2017; Burda et al., 2018; 2019). Besides using
prediction error, diverse skills can also be discovered by maximizing the mutual information between
skills and states as the intrinsic motivation (Eysenbach et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2020). While these
approaches have achieved encouraging results in single agent cases, they are not directly applicable
to environments with multiple agents. In our paper, we propose a novel intrinsic regularization for
helping two robots work actively on different sub-tasks.


-----

**Multi-agent collaboration. Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning has exhibited progress**
over the recent years (Foerster et al., 2016; He et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2017; Lowe et al., 2017;
Foerster et al., 2018; Sunehag et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2018; Son et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a).
For example, Lowe et al. (2017) proposed to extend the DDPG (Lillicrap et al., 2016) algorithm
to the multi-agent setting with decentralized policies and centralized Q functions, which implicitly
encourages the agents to cooperate. However, the problem of exploration still remains as a bottleneck,
and in fact even more severe in multi-agent RL. Motivated by the previous success on a single agent,
intrinsic motivation is also introduced to help multiple agents explore and collaborate (Foerster et al.,
2016; Strouse et al., 2018; Hughes et al., 2018; Iqbal & Sha, 2019b; Jaques et al., 2019; Wang et al.,
2020b). For example, Jaques et al. (2019) proposed to use social motivation to provide intrinsic
rewards which model the influence of one agent on another agent’s decision making. The work that is
most related to ours is by Chitnis et al. (2020b) on the intrinsic motivation for synergistic behaviors,
which encourages the robots to collaborate for a task that is hard to solve by a single robot. As this
paper has not focused on the domination and conflict problems, our work on disentangled attention is
a complementary technique to the previous work.

**Bimanual manipulation. The field of bimanual manipulation has been long studied as a problem**
involving both hardware design and control (Raibert & Craig, 1981; Hsu, 1993; Xi et al., 1996; Smith
et al., 2012). In recent years, researchers applied learning based approach to bimanual manipulation
using imitation learning from demonstrations (Zollner et al.; Gribovskaya & Billard, 2008; Tung et al.,
2020; Xie et al., 2020) and reinforcement learning (Kroemer et al., 2015; Amadio et al., 2019; Chitnis
et al., 2020a;b; Ha et al., 2020). For example, Amadio et al. (2019) proposed to leverage probabilistic
movement primitives from human demonstrations. Chitnis et al. (2020a) further introduced a highlevel planning policy to combine a set of parameterized primitives to solve complex manipulation
tasks. In contrast to these works, our approach does not assume access to pre-defined primitives.
Both robots will learn how to perform each sub-task and how to collaborate without conflicts in an
end-to-end manner, which makes the approach more general.

**Attention mechanism. Our intrinsic motivation is built upon the attention mechanism which has**
been widely applied in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017) and computer vision (Wang
et al., 2018; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Recently, the attention mechanism is also utilized in multi-agent
RL to model the communication and collaboration between agents (Zambaldi et al., 2018; Jiang &
Lu, 2018; Malysheva et al., 2018; Iqbal & Sha, 2019a; Long et al., 2020). For example, Long et al.
(2020) proposed to utilize attention to flexibly increase the number of agents and perform curriculum
learning for large-scale multi-agent interactions. Li et al. (2020) adopt the attention mechanism to
generalize multi-object stacking with a single arm. In our paper, instead of simply using attention for
interaction among hand and a variable number of objects, we propose DAIR to encourage the agents
to attend on different sub-tasks for better collaboration.

3 PRELIMINARIES

We consider a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) Littman (1994) with N agents, which can
be represented by (S, A, P, R, H, γ). The state s _S and the action ai_ _A for agent i are continuous._
_P_ (s[t][+1]|s[t], a[t]1[, ..., a][t]N [)][ represents the stochastic transition dynamics.] ∈ _[ R] ∈[i][(][s][t][, a]i[t][)][ represents the reward]_
function for agent i. H is the horizon and γ is the discount factor. The policy πθi (a[t] _s[t]) for agent i is_
_|_
parameterized by θi. The goal is to learn multi-agent policies maximizing the return. In this paper,
we tackle a two-agent collaboration problem (N = 2), but our method can generalize to more agents.

3.1 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH SOFT ACTOR-CRITIC
We adopt the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Haarnoja et al. (2018) for reinforcement learning (RL) training
in this paper. It is an off-policy RL method using the actor-critic framework. The soft Q-function for
agent i is Qθi (s[t], a[t]i[)][ parameterized by][ θ][i][. For agent][ i][, there are three types of parameters to learn in]
SAC: (i) the policy parameters φi; (ii) a temperature τi; (iii) the soft Q-function parameters θi. We
can represent the policy optimization objective for agent i as,

_Jπ(φi) = Est∼D_ Eati[∼][π][φ]i [[][τ][i][ log][ π][φ][i] [(][a]i[t][|][s][t][)][ −] _[Q][θ]i_ [(][s][t][, a][t]i[)]] _,_ (1)
h i

where τi is a learnable temperature coefficient for agent i, and D is the replay buffer. It can be learned
to maintain the entropy level of the policy:

_J(τi) = Eati[∼][π][φ]i_ _τi log πφi_ (a[t]i[|][s][t][)][ −] _[τ][i]_ [¯] _,_ (2)

where _H[¯] is a desired minimum expected entropy. The soft Q-function parameters θi for agent i can_
be trained by minimizing the soft Bellman residual as,

_JQ(θi) = E(st,ati[)][∼D]_ 2 [(][Q][θ][i] [(][s][t][, a]i[t][)][ −] _Q[ˆ](s[t], a[t]i[))][2]_ _,_ (3)

Since we focus on collaborative robotics manipulation tasks, the reward is always shared and
synchronized among the agents. That is, if one agent is able to finish a goal and obtain a reward, the
other agents will receive the same reward.

3.2 CRITERIA FOR MEASURING EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY

Our core contribution is to ensure the manipulating efficiency and safety by reducing the problems of
domination and conflict in the process of manipulation, which also improves the speed of finishing
the task. We define three criteria which are all lower the better, and evaluate our approach using them
in our experiments: (i) Domination Rate: We count how many steps an arm is interacting with an
object in one episode as the manipulating steps. We compute the ratio of an agent’s manipulating
steps over the two agents’ total manipulating steps. We select the maximum ratio as the Domination
Rate. Ideally, we hope the Domination Rate to be close to 50% which indicates both robots are
actively interacting with the objects. (ii) Conflict Rate: It counts the percentage of the “conflict step”
over all steps. We consider it a conflict step when the distance between two grippers is smaller than a
small threshold. This means two robots are interrupting each other’s action. (iii) Finish Steps: How
many steps do two agents take to finish the task successfully. The maximum episode length in both
environments is 100. Note that it’s reasonable only when we consider all the metrics together, since
robots can use trivial solution to reduce one of them, for example, only complete the task with one
robot (extreme domination behavior) to avoid conflicts.

4 METHOD

Our goal is to design a model and introduce a novel intrinsic regularization to better train the policies
for bimanual manipulation tasks. We hope the agents can learn to allocate the workload efficiently
and safely. In this section, we will first introduce our base network architecture with the attention
mechanism motivated by (Vaswani et al., 2017). Based on this architecture, we will then introduce
DAIR and how to perform reinforcement learning with it.

4.1 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

Policy and Q-function networks share the same architecture as follow. For simplicity, we
omit superscript time t when there is no ambiguity. We can then represent the state as s =

[s1, . . ., sN _, sN_ +1, . . ., sN +M ] where the first N entities represent the state of the robot arms, the
next M entities represent the states of the interaction regions. Here we define an interaction region as
a space on object that robot can manipulate on (grasp or push, etc) to handle the task. In Figure 1,
for the first four tasks with smaller objects such as cubes, door, and cover, we define one interaction
region located around each object. For the last task of adjusting a large heavy bar, we define it with
two interaction regions with one region corresponding to one face. Note that the interaction regions
can be specified according to the tasks flexibly, and our method can be generalized to any numbers of
interaction regions.

For agent i, we have a set of state encoder functions _fi,1(_ ), . . ., fi,N ( ), fi,N +1( ), . . ., fi,N +M ( )
_{_ _·_ _·_ _·_ _·_ _}_
corresponding to the input states, as shown in Figure 2. Each state encoder function fi,j( ) takes

_·_
the state sj as the input and outputs a representation (512-D) for the state in our policy network.
We use a 2-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) to model fi,j( ). While there are N + M state

_·_
encoder functions, there are only three sets of parameters (visualized by three different colors in
Figure 2): (i) the parameters of the state encoder for agent i itself fi,i( ); (ii) the parameters of the

_·_
other agents fi,j( ), (1 _j_ _N, i_ = j) (shared); (iii) the parameters of all the interaction regions

_·_ _≤_ _≤_ _̸_
_fi,j(_ ), (N + 1 _j_ _N + M_ ) (shared). In this way, our model can be extended to environments

_·_ _≤_ _≤_
with different number of interaction regions and agents. We represent the policy for agent i as,

_πφi_ (ai _s) = hi(fi,i(si)+LayerNorm(gi(vi))),_ (5)
_|_


-----

where gi( ) is one fully connected layer to further process the attention embedding vi, which encodes

_·_
the relationship between agent i and all the state entities (including all agents and interaction regions).
Adding attention embedding to fi,i(si) with a LayerNorm operator serves as a residual module to
retain agent i’s own state information. The combined features are fed to a 2-layer MLP hi( ). The

_·_
output of hi( ) is the action distribution. Note that the parameters of hi( ), gi( ) are not shared across

_·_ _·_ _·_
the agents.

Motivated by Vaswani et al. (2017), we further define the attention embedding vi for agent i as,

_N_ +M

exp (βi,j) _i,i[(][s][i][)][W][ T]q_ _[W][k][f][i,j][(][s][j][)]_

_vi =_ _j=1_ _αi,jfi,j(sj),_ _αi,j =_ exp (βi,j) _,_ _βi,j =_ _[f][ T]_ _dq_ _,_ (6)

X

P p

where Wq represents one fully connected layer to encode the query representation fi,i(si) and Wq
represents another fully connected layer to encode the key representation fi,j(sj). dq is the dimension
of the query representation. βi,j represents the correlation between agent i and all the other entities.

It is then normalized by a softmax function to αi,j as the probability value, which indicates where
weighted sum over all the state encoder representations. For Q-function, there are two modifications:agent i is “attending” or focusing on in the current time step and αi ∈ R[N] [+][M] . vi is computed via a

the Q-function network outputs a scalar value instead of an action distribution as Qθi (s[t], a[t]i[)][, which]
is used in Eq. 1 and Eq 3.

attend on different entities (including agents and interaction regions). We call this particular attention
maps regulated by the orthogonal constraint as disentangled attention.

Recall that αi is predicted via the state encoder functions, parameterized by a part of φi. Instead
of proposing a new reward function, our disentangled attention regularization is directly applied on
learning the state encoder representation itself. The training objective for the policy network and

where λ = 0.05 is a constant to balance the reinforcement learning objective and our regularization.

**Implementation Details. The robot state si(1 ≤** _i ≤_ _N_ ) contains the joint positions and velocities
and the end-effector positions. Thus each robot can reason the other robot’s joint state and avoid
conflicts. Each interaction region si(N + 1 _i_ _N + M_ ) contains the target interacting position,
_≤_ _≤_
velocity, pose and its goal position, which are all in (x, y, z)-coordinates. The action representation
contains the positional control and the gripper motion information.

5 EXPERIMENTS

**Environment and setting. We perform our experiments on complex bimanual manipulation tasks**
(N = 2) in the MuJoCo simulator (Todorov et al., 2012). By further leveraging curriculum learning,
we successfully complete the scenarios with up to eight objects with sparse rewards. We evaluate the
sample efficiency of training, conflict rate, domination rate, and completion steps across approaches to
demonstrate that DAIR can (i) help discover efficient collaboration strategies; (ii) improve efficiency
and safety by avoiding domination and conflict; (iii) bring adaptation capability with learned task
decomposition knowledge; (iv) retain learning capability of synergistic skills.

**Baselines. We compare our approach with three baselines: (i) The same architecture as our model**
with the attention mechanism, but without the intrinsic regularization (Attention); (ii) SAC with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network; (iii) Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (Lowe
et al., 2017) with MLP (MADDPG + MLP). We also tried replacing DDPG with SAC in MADDPG
but observed minor differences. Thus we only report results with MADDPG + MLP for simplicity.

**Training details. All networks and learnable parameters are trained with Adam optimizer (Kingma**
& Ba, 2015) with learning rate 0.0001, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999. We set the discount factor as γ =
0.98, buffer size as 1M, and batch size as 512 for all tasks. We follow the replay k setting in
HER (Andrychowicz et al., 2017), and set k = 4 with the future-replace strategy. We update the
network parameters after every two episodes. The episode length equals 50 times the object number
for each environment. We train all the methods with 3 seeds and report both the mean and standard
derivation for the success rate. More details are in Appendix B.

5.1 SUB-TASK ALLOCATION FOR COLLABORATION

We first perform our experiments on two tasks that requires alternately operating different parts in a
certain order to show DAIR balancedly and safely allocates the sub-tasks for solving one task. The
first task is Open Box and Place (Figure 1 (c)): The robots need to put the blue block object inside
the box with a sliding cover, which requires one robot arm to open the sliding cover for the other
robot arm to put the object inside. The second task is Push with Door (Figure 1 (d)): The robots need
to push the blue object to the goal on the other side of a sliding green door that requires one robot
arm to open it and clear the way for the pushing arm (with the grasping function disabled). In both
cases, we also apply a force on the sliding cover/door for it to bounce back to its original position if
there is no outside forces. The following results show that DAIR not only helps achieve better sample
efficiency and performance, but more importantly, addresses the problems of domination and conflict,
thus further reduces the steps to finish the task at the same time.

**Reward setting. We consider two different reward settings: (i) a sparse reward setting where the**
agents only obtain a reward 1.0 when the block is on the target position; (ii) a informative reward
setting which gives a reward 1.0 when the box/door is open and another reward 1.0 when the block
reaches to the goal. If the block reaches its goal in a trial, we count it as a successful trial.

**Comparison on success rate. We plot the success rate of all the methods over the environment steps**
in Figure 3. We can observe that DAIR achieves better sample efficiency and better success rate than
the baselines in most cases. We also observe that in both environments, DAIR and Attention achieve
better success rate in the sparse reward setting than using informative reward. The reason is that
sparse reward offers more flexibility for the agents to collaborate under the guidance with intrinsic
disentangled attention, while the explicit informative reward can lead to local minimum more easily.

reward (right in each group), where agents only receive a success reward when all the goals are reached; (ii)
an informative reward (left in each group), where agent will additionally receive a reward for reaching each
individual goal in addition to the final success reward.

large (e.g., λ=0.2). In our practice, we choose λ=0.05 for all the experiments.

**Ablation on λ. We set the hyperparameter λ = 0.05 (defined in Equation 8 for balancing the**
regularization) in all our experiments. To study the stability of DAIR, we perform ablation on different
values of λ in Figure 4. We observe that our method is robust to the change of λ from 0.02 to 0.2.


**Comparison on the three criteria. Table 1 shows**
the comparison on the three criteria defined in Section 3.2. We observe significant improvements over
all the settings using intrinsic regularization, which
proves that using disentangled attention can lead to
better collaboration. For example, in the task of Open
Box and Place with informative reward, our approach
achieves almost half less conflict rate, 24% less domination rate, and 12 fewer steps comparing to the
Attention baseline without the intrinsic regularization. For Push with Door using sparse reward, we
reduce more than half the conflict rate.

We perform ablation by introducing an extra collision
penalty during training: Two robots will receive −1.0
reward if their grippers collide to each other. Note
that such a reward is not realistic in practice since we
do not hope the robots to collide to get the reward.
We show the Conflict rate for both Attention baseline
and our approach training with this collision penalty
in Table 2. DAIR shows consistent improvements
and remains to be an effective way to reduce conflicts
even with the collision penalty.

**Visualization on attention probability α. We vi-**
sualize the two tasks in Figure 5. In each task, we
visualize the attention α1 and α2 for each robot in
two rows. Each attention vector αi contains four
items that correspond to left arm (1st column), right
arm (2nd column), and the two task-specific interaction regions (last 2 columns). Figure 5 (a) shows
the Push with Door task: The left arm is interacting with the object block, so it has a high value in
the corresponding probability α1,3 (1st row and 3rd

column); the right arm is interacting with the door, it also has a high value in the corresponding probability α2,4 (2nd row and 4th column). Similarly in Figure 5 (b) for the Open Box and
Place task, a high probability with αi,j indicates the ith arm is interacting with object j. The
two interaction regions here are the block object (3rd column) and the box cover (4th column).

5.2 GENERALIZING TO MORE OBJECTS WITH CURRICULUM LEARNING


We increase the number of objects and train with curricu-lum to show that the regularized representation gains better 𝛼1
learning capacity when task gradually becomes harder. We
test on Stack Tower (Figure 1 (b)), where the robots need
to stack objects as a tower with indicated goal positions;
andto rearrange the objects to their own goal locations on Rearrangement (Figure 1 (a)), where the robots need 𝛼1
the table. When manipulating one object in these envi- 𝛼2
ronments, it is easy for the arm to perturb other objects
without intention. We train RL agents for both tasks in (b)

reward 1.0 when each object reaches its goal. We leverage Each row corresponds to one robot arm atcurriculum learning to start training the agents to manip- tending to four items. (a) Push with Door:
ulate one object and then gradually increase the objects to one robot holds the door while the other

one robot opens the box while the other picks

We evaluate our approach on two aspects: (i) How does the block.
the approach perform in each curriculum stage; (ii) How
does the approach generalize to object numbers that exceed its training number (up to eight objects
in the Rearrangement task). DAIR achieves better results in both aspects, especially in generalization
to multiple objects.

**Results on each curriculum stage. We first compare DAIR to Attention on 3-block Rearrangement**
and Stack Tower tasks. Note that both MLP and MADDPG+MLP baselines cannot handle a flexible
number of objects due to fixed dimensions of inputs. Thus it is not applicable in these two tasks with
curriculum learning, and directly training both of them with 3 objects leads to zero success rate. This
also suggests that DAIR and Attention have the flexibility to handle a variant number of input objects.
DAIR gains significant improvements over Attention in all different training stages. Our gain over
Attention even becomes larger as the number of objects increases.

**Results on generalization. We conduct generalization experiments on both tasks where we test the**
policies trained with i objects on the same environment with i + k objects. We show the results of
generalization success rate in Table 3 and 4 with the columns labeled by i → _i+k. For Stack Tower,_
DAIR trained with 2-block stacking generalizes to stacking 2 towers each with 2 blocks (last column
in Table 3), while Attention completely fails. For Rearrangement, DAIR can rearrange 8 objects even
we only train it to rearrange 3 objects (last column in Table 4), while Attention fails to generalize to
even 4 objects. We conjecture that the reason for improvement is similar to conclusions in continual
learning area (Delange et al., 2021): regularizing parameters with simple L2 loss avoids overfit to
specific stage of task and gains better generalization ability in continually shifted tasks.

**Visualization on stacking and rearrangement.** We visualize the three demonstrations for our
approach in Figure 6: (a) stacking 3 blocks; (b) stacking 2 towers each with 2 blocks using the
policy trained with 2 block-stacking; (c) rearranging 8 blocks to their target positions using the
rearrangement policy trained with 3 blocks. For stacking tasks, both robots are able to pick up
different objects without interrupting the other robot and the stacked tower. For the rearrangement
task, the policy is transferred to rearrange 8 objects, far beyond the training object number 3. The
two robots are still able to collaborate without conflicts to solve the tasks. Please refer to our project
page for more policy visualization in videos.

5.3 SYNERGISTIC BEHAVIORS DISCOVERY


Besides manipulation tasks with multiple objects, DAIR
retains the ability to help two robots collaboratively manipulate one object with multiple interaction regions. To
analyze the ability on such synergistic skills learning, we
conduct experiment on the Adjust Bar task, as visualized
in Figure 1 (e). This task requires the two robots to lift and
rotate a heavy bar to target height and orientation. We lock
the gripper to the closed state and set the bar’s mass and
size large so the two robots have to collaborate to finish the
task. The interaction region state inputs are represented by
the 3D position of two sides of the bar. The goal is defined
by the target positions of the two sides of the bar. The
reward is sparse that only an accurate adjustment gives
1.0 to two robots. DAIR maintains advantage on performance over the Attention baseline as shown in Table 5 and
Figure 7. Two robots can successfully clamp up the bar
with the opposite forces with very consistent movements.
Such results suggest that DAIR is not harmful for learning
synergistic skills when it encourages the robots to look at
different interaction regions. DAIR also serves as a mechanism to avoid overfitting to domination and help robots
to finish the task efficiently with smaller finish steps.

6 CONCLUSION


Table 5: Adjust Bar task. DAIR improves
baseline over domination rate and finish steps.
Conflict rate is not computed here since two
end effectors will be close when the task is
solved.

DAIR still retains learning efficiency though
augmented with disentangled attention.


While previous works consider how to learn collaborative skills like synergistic behavior, we notice
two main limitations in complex bimanual manipulation tasks: domination and conflict, corresponding
to the efficiency and safety of control. We propose a simple and effective DAIR to solve these
problems. We validate our approach on challenging bimanual manipulation tasks with multiple
objects (up to 8 objects) or one objects with multiple interaction regions. We demonstrate that DAIR
not only reduces the domination and conflict problems but also improves the generalization ability of
the policies to manipulate much more objects than in the training environments. We hope our work
contributes as a step towards safe robotics.

A TASK DESCRIPTIONS AND DETAILS

(a) Push with Door (b) Open box and Place (c) Stack Tower (d) Rearrangement (e) Adjust Bar

Figure 8: The environments used in our experiments

A.1 ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTIONS

**Push with Door, Figure 8(a).** The two robots are placed on both sides of a 100cm × 70cm table,
opposite each other (all robot manipulation environments are same for this setting). The goal is to
push a block through a sliding door and make it reach the target position on the other side of the door.
We put a spring on the sliding door, such that it will close automatically in the absence of external
force. The initial positions of the projections of the two grippers onto the table plane are sampled in a
40cm × 40cm square on the table (all robot manipulation environments are same for this setting).
The initial position of block and the goal position are sampled from a circle with radius 20cm around
the table center. We fix the initial height of the two grippers (all robot manipulation environments are
same for this setting), and set the initial position of door at the center of the table.

**Open box and Place, Figure 8(b).** The task is to pick up the block on the table and place it into
the box in table center. We put a spring on the sliding lid of the box, so it will close automatically in
the absence of external force. The initial positions of the block and goal are sampled from a circle
with radius 20cm at the center of the table, outside the box.

**Stack Tower, Figure 8(c).** The task is to stack several blocks into a tower. All blocks are randomly
sampled from a circle with radius 20cm around the center of the table. We perform curriculum
learning in this environment, with one more block sampled in each stage. In the first stage in the
curriculum, we have one block, we sample the corresponding goal with the height randomly from
0cm to 30cm. In each following stage, we sample one more object block and goal. After the first
stage, the goals will form into a tower.

**Rearrangement, Figure 8(d).** The task is to push multiple blocks to their corresponding target
positions on the table. We perform curriculum learning in this environment, with one more block
sampled in each stage. All blocks and goals are randomly sampled from a circle with radius 20cm
around the table center. We train our method up to 3 blocks (3 curriculum stages) and generalize the
approach to up to 8 blocks.

**Adjust Bar, Figure 8(e).** The task is to adjust a heavy bar to the state that the two sides of it match
with the two blue goal positions. That requires the height and the orientation are matched. We
randomly sample the two goal positions but make sure the distance between them equals to the length
of bar. We fix the gripper to force two robots synergistically use the force in opposite direction to
pinch up the bar.

A.2 OBSERVATION SPACE

The observation vector consists of object states, robot states, and the goals for the objects. Specifically,
the object states consist of the position and velocity of all the objects. The robot stages consist of
the position and velocity of the gripper and the robot joints. The goal vector consists of the target
position coordinates.


-----

A.3 ACTION SPACE

For robot tasks, the action is a 8-dimensional vector, which is the concatenation of two 4-dimensional
action vectors for each robot. For each robot, the first 3 elements indicates the desired position
shift of the end-effector and the last element controls the gripper fingers (locked in push with door
scenario). For mass point tasks, the action is a 4-dimensional vector, similarly combined with two
2-dimensional vectors for each mass point. The 2-dimensional action vector only controls the the
desired position shift of the end-effector in a plane.

B TRAINING SAMPLE NUMBER

For Push with Door and Open Box and Place, we use 10M samples to train; For Tower Stack and
_Rearrangement, we leverage curriculum learning and increase the number of blocks by one in each_
stage. Specifically, we list the number of samples for each stage of training in Table 6.

Table 6: Training samples for curriculum learning in each stage

Num of Block 1 2 3

Tower Stack 2 × 10[6] 6 × 10[6] 9 × 10[6]

Rearrangement 1 × 10[6] 3 × 10[6] 5 × 10[6]

**Computation. In our experiments, we use a single GPU and 8 CPU cores for all the method on each**
task.
