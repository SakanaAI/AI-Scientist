Paper under double-blind review

ABSTRACT

Most neural text-to-speech (TTS) models require ⟨speech, transcript⟩ paired data
from the desired speaker for high-quality speech synthesis, which limits the usage of large amounts of untranscribed data for training. In this work, we present
Guided-TTS, a high-quality TTS model that learns to generate speech from untranscribed speech data. Guided-TTS combines an unconditional diffusion probabilistic model with a separately trained phoneme classifier for text-to-speech.
By modeling the unconditional distribution for speech, our model can utilize the
untranscribed data for training. For text-to-speech synthesis, we guide the generative process of the unconditional DDPM via phoneme classification to produce
mel-spectrograms from the conditional distribution given transcript. We show that
Guided-TTS achieves comparable performance with the existing methods without any transcript for LJSpeech. Our results further show that a single speakerdependent phoneme classifier trained on multispeaker large-scale data can guide
unconditional DDPMs for various speakers to perform TTS.

1 INTRODUCTION

Neural text-to-speech (TTS) models have been achieved to generate high-quality human-like speech
given text (van den Oord et al. (2016); Shen et al. (2018)). In general, these TTS models are conditional generative models that encode text into the hidden representation and generate speech from
the encoded representation. Early TTS models are autoregressive generative models which generate
high-quality speech but suffer from slow synthesis speed due to the sequential sampling procedure
(Shen et al. (2018); Li et al. (2019)). Owing to the development of non-autoregressive generative
models, recent TTS models are capable of generating high-quality speech with faster inference speed
(Ren et al. (2019); Ren et al. (2021); Kim et al. (2020); Popov et al. (2021)). Recently, high-quality
end-to-end TTS models have been proposed that generate raw waveform from the text at once (Kim
et al. (2021); Weiss et al. (2021); Chen et al. (2021b)).

Despite the high-quality and fast inference speed of speech synthesis, most TTS models can be
trained only if the transcribed data of the desired speaker is given. While long-form untranscribed
data, such as audiobooks or podcasts, is available on various websites, it is challenging to use these
unpaired speech data to train existing TTS models. To utilize these untranscribed data, long-form
untranscribed speech data has to be segmented into sentence-level, and then each segmented speech
should be transcribed accurately. Since the existing TTS models must directly model the conditional
distribution of speech given text, the direct usage of untranscribed data remains challenging to solve.

In this work, we propose Guided-TTS, an unconditional diffusion-based generative model trained
on untranscribed data that leverages a phoneme classifier for text-to-speech synthesis. Trained on
untranscribed speech data for the desired speaker, our unconditional diffusion probabilistic model
learns to generate mel-spectrograms of the speaker without any context. As training data does not
have to be aligned with text sequence for unconditional speech modeling, we simply use random
chunks of untranscribed speech to train our unconditional generative model. This allows us to build
training data without extra effort in modeling the speech of speakers for which only long-form
untranscribed speech data is available.

To guide the unconditional DDPM for TTS, we train a framewise phoneme classifier on transcribed
data and use the gradients of the classifier during sampling. Although our unconditional generative


-----

model is trained without any transcript, Guided-TTS effectively generates mel-spectrograms given
the transcript by guiding the generative process of unconditional DDPM with the phoneme classifier.

We demonstrate that the proposed method, TTS by guiding the unconditional DDPM, matches the
performance of the existing conditional TTS models on LJSpeech. We further show that by training
the phoneme classifier on multi-speaker paired dataset, Guided-TTS also shows comparable performance without seeing any transcript of LJSpeech, which shows the possibility to build a high-quality
text-to-speech model without a transcript for the desired speaker. We encourage the readers to listen
to samples of Guided-TTS trained on various untranscribed datasets on our demo page. [1]

2 BACKGROUND

2.1 DENOISING DIFFUSION PROBABLISTIC MODELS (DDPM) AND ITS VARIANT

DDPM (Ho et al. (2020)), which is recently proposed as a kind of probabilistic generative model,
has been applied to various domains such as image (Dhariwal & Nichol (2021)) and audio (Chen
et al. (2021a); Popov et al. (2021)). DDPM first defines a forward process that gradually corrupts
data X0 to a random noise XT across T timesteps. The model learns the reverse process that follows
the reverse trajectory of the predefined forward process to generate data from random noise.

Recently, there have been approaches to formulate the trajectory between data and noise as a continuous stochastic differential equation (SDE) instead of a discrete-time Markov process (Song et al.
(2021b)). Grad-TTS (Popov et al. (2021)) introduces SDE formulation to TTS, which we have followed and used. According to the formulation of Grad-TTS, the forward process that corrupts data
_X0 into the standard Gaussian noise XT is as follows:_


_dXt =_
_−_ [1]2 _[X][t][β][t][dt][ +]_


_βtdWt,_ (1)


where(1982) showed that the reverse process, which represents the trajectory from noise βt is a predefined noise schedule, βt = β0+(βT −β0)t, and Wt is a Wiener process. Anderson XT to X0, can
be formulated in SDE, which is defined as follows:


_dXt = (_ _βtdW[f]t,_ (2)
_−_ [1]2 _[X][t][ −∇][X][t][ log][ p][t][(][X][t][))][β][t][dt][ +]_ p

where _Wt is a reverse time Wiener process. Given the score, the gradient of log density with respect_
to data (i.e., ∇Xt log pt(Xt)), for t ∈ [0, T ], we can sample data X0 from random noise XT by
solving Eq. (2). To generate data, the DDPM learns to estimate the score with the neural network sθ

[f]
parameterized by θ.

To estimate the score, Xt is sampled from the distribution derived from Eq. (1) given data X0, which
is as follows:
_Xt_ _X0_ (ρ(X0, t), λ(t)), (3)

_t_ _|_ _∼N_ _t_

where ρ(X0, t) = e[−] [1]2 0 _[β][s][ds]X0, and λ(t) = I_ e[−] 0 _[β][s][ds]. Then, the score can be derived from Eq._

(3); ∇Xt log pt(Xt|X0R) = −λ(t)[−][1]ϵt, given X−0 (Popov et al. (2021)). To train the modelR _sθ(Xt, t)_
for ∀t ∈ [0, T ], the following loss is used:

_L(θ) = EtEX0_ Eϵt _sθ(Xt, t) + λ(t)[−][1]ϵt_ 2 (4)

which is L2 loss as in previous works (Ho et al. (2020), Song et al. (2021b)). 

[2]

Using the model sθ(Xt, t), we can generate sample X0 from noise by solving Eq. (2). Grad-TTS
generates data X0 from XT by setting T = 1 and using a fixed discretization strategy (Song et al.
(2021b)):


_Xt−_ _N1_ [=][ X][t][ +][ β]N[t] [(1]2 _[X][t][ +][ ∇][X][t][ log][ p][t][(][X][t][)) +]_


_βN t_ _[z][t]_ (5)


where N is the number of steps to solve SDE, t ∈{ _N[1]_ _[,][ 2]N_ _[, ...,][ 1][}][ and][ z][t][ is a standard Gaussian noise.]_

2.2 CLASSIFIER GUIDANCE

DDPM can be guided to generate samples with the desired condition without fine-tuning with the
introduction of a classifier. Song et al. (2021b) used the unconditional DDPM to generate classconditional images using a separately trained image classifier. Not only unconditional DDPM but
also conditional DDPM can be guided using the classifier, which contributes to achieving state-ofthe-art performance for class-conditional image generation (Dhariwal & Nichol (2021)).

For conditional generation, the classifier pt(y|Xt) is trained to classify the noisy data Xt as the
condition y. If Eq. (5) is modified, discretized SDE for the conditional generation can be obtained.


_Xt−_ _N1_ [=][ X][t][ +][ β]N[t] [(1]2 _[X][t][ +][ ∇][X][t][ log][ p][t][(][X][t][|][y][)) +]_


_βN t_ _[z][t]_ (6)


_∇Xt log pt(Xt|y) = ∇Xt log pt(Xt) + ∇Xt log pt(y|Xt)_ (7)

If the unconditional score and the classifier for the condition are given, the sample X0 with the
condition y can be generated using Eq. (6).

3 GUIDED-TTS

In this section, we present Guided-TTS, which aims to build a high-quality text-to-speech model
without the transcript of the target speaker. While other TTS models directly learn to generate speech
from text, Guided-TTS models the unconditional distribution of speech to utilize speech-only data
and guides the unconditional model to generate speech with a given text. To the best of our knowledge, Guided-TTS is the first TTS model that generates speech with the unconditional generative
model.

Both unconditional speech modeling and controllable generation with the unconditional generative
model are well known to be challenging. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a diffusion-based generative model for unconditional speech generation, which has the advantages of modeling complex
distributions and easy controllability. Additionally, we introduce a phoneme classifier to guide the
unconditional DDPM for TTS, which requires transcribed data for training.

In Guided-TTS, the generative model and the phoneme classifier are trained separately so that we can
utilize different datasets to train each module. For instance, assume only the untranscribed speech
data of the target speaker for TTS is available. With Guided-TTS, the phoneme classifier can still be
trained on other transcribed datasets that contain rich, large-scale multi-speaker data. The phoneme
classifier trained in such a manner effectively guides the generative model, trained only using the
untranscribed speech data of the target speaker. By doing so, with the two modules independent of
each other, we can achieve the text-to-speech model without any transcript of the target speaker.

Guided-TTS consists of 4 modules: the unconditional DDPM, the phoneme classifier, the duration
predictor, and the speaker encoder, as shown in Fig. 1. Unconditional DDPM is a module that learns
to generate mel-spectrogram unconditionally, and the remaining three modules are for TTS synthesis
by guidance. We will explain the unconditional DDPM in Section 3.1, followed by the method of
guiding the unconditional model for TTS in Section 3.2.

3.1 UNCONDITIONAL DDPM

Our unconditional DDPM models the unconditional distribution of speech PX without any transcript. We assume that the training data for the diffusion-based model has tens of hours of untranscribed speech data from the target speaker S for TTS. As our generative model learns only with
speech data, training samples do not need to be aligned with the text. Thus, we use random chunks
of untranscribed speech as training data to reduce the burden of not only speech transcription but
also segmentation when only the long-form speech data is available for the target speaker.

Given a mel-spectrogram X = X0, we define a forward process as in Eq. (1), which gradually
corrupts data into noise, and approximate the reverse process in Eq. (2) by estimating the unconditional score _Xt_ log p(Xt) for each timestep t. At each iteration, Xt, t [0, 1] is sampled from
_∇_ _∈_
the mel-spectrogram X0 as in Eq. (3), and score is estimated with the neural network sθ(Xt, t)
parameterized by θ. The training objective of our unconditional model is in Eq. (4).

speech X0 without the transcript. The other modules, the phoneme classifier, duration predictor, and
speaker encoder are for guiding the unconditional DDPM to generate conditional samples given y.
The speaker embedding eS is only used for training speaker-dependent modules.


Similar to Grad-TTS (Popov et al. (2021)), we regard mel-spectrogram as a 2D image with a single
channel and use the U-Net architecture (Ronneberger et al. (2015)) as sθ. We use the same size of
the architecture used to model 32 × 32 sized images in Ho et al. (2020) to capture long-term dependencies without any text information, while Grad-TTS uses smaller architecture for the conditional
distribution modeling.

3.2 TEXT-TO-SPEECH VIA CLASSIFIER GUIDANCE

For TTS synthesis, we use a framewise phoneme classifier to guide the unconditional DDPM. As
shown in Fig. 1, in order to generate mel-spectrogram given text, our duration predictor outputs the
duration for each text token and expands the transcript y to frame-level phoneme label ˆy. Then, we
sample a random noise XT of the same length as ˆy from the standard normal distribution, and we
can generate conditional samples by replacing the unconditional score in Eq. (5) with the conditional
score. As in Eq. (8), we can estimate the conditional score on the left side by adding the two terms
on the right side: the first term is obtained from the unconditional DDPM, and the second term can
be computed with the phoneme classifier. That is, we achieve to build a text-to-speech model with
the unconditional generative model for the speech by adding the gradient of the phoneme classifier
during the generative process.

_Xt_ log p(Xt _y, spkˆ_ = S) = _Xt_ log pθ(Xt _spk = S) +_ _Xt_ log pφ(ˆy _Xt, spk = S)_ (8)
_∇_ _|_ _∇_ _|_ _∇_ _|_

If the transcribed speech dataset of the target speaker S is available, we train all the unconditional
DDPM, the phoneme classifier, and the duration predictor on the dataset of the speaker S for TTS.
Otherwise, if we only have the untranscribed speech data for the target speaker S, we first train
unconditional DDPM on the untranscribed speech data and leverage a large-scale multi-speaker
transcribed speech dataset to train the phoneme classifier and the duration predictor. In this case, to
guide unconditional DDPM for the target speaker S, our phoneme classifier and duration predictor
are designed to be speaker-dependent modules and to generalize well to the unseen speaker S during training. We provide the speaker embedding extracted from the pre-trained speaker verification
network as condition to both modules, as described in Fig. 1. We describe each module required for
guidance below.

**Phoneme Classifier The phoneme classifier is a network trained on transcribed data that recog-**
nizes the phoneme corresponding to each frame of the input mel-spectrogram. To train the framewise phoneme classifier, we align transcript and speech using a forced alignment tool, Montreal
Forced Aligner (MFA) (McAuliffe et al. (2017)), and extract the frame-level phoneme label ˆy. The
phoneme classifier is trained to classify the corrupted mel-spectrogram Xt sampled from Eq. (3) as
the frame-level phoneme label ˆy. The training objective of the phoneme classifier is to maximize the


-----

expectation of cross-entropy between the phoneme label ˆy and the output probability with respect to
_t ∈_ [0, 1].

We use a WaveNet-like architecture (van den Oord et al. (2016)) as a phoneme classifier, and time
embedding et, which is extracted in the same way as in Popov et al. (2021), is used as a global
condition in WaveNet to provide information about the noise level of the corrupted input Xt at
timestep t. Additionally, for speaker-dependent classification, we use the speaker embedding eS
from the speaker encoder as the global condition.

**Duration Predictor Duration predictor is a module that predicts the duration of each text token for**
a given text sequence y. We extract the duration label of each text token using MFA for the same
data on which the phoneme classifier is trained. The duration predictor is trained to minimize L2
loss between the duration label and the estimated duration in the log-domain, and we round up the
estimated duration during inference. The architecture of the duration predictor is the same as that
of Glow-TTS (Kim et al. (2020)) with the text encoder. We concatenate the text embedding and the
speaker embedding eS for training a speaker-dependent module.

**Speaker Encoder Speaker encoder encodes the speaker information from the input mel-**
spectrogram and outputs the speaker embedding eS. Similar to Jia et al. (2018), we train a speaker
encoder with GE2E loss (Wan et al. (2018)) on the speaker verification dataset and use speaker encoder to condition speaker-dependent modules. To train speaker-dependent modules, we use speaker
embedding eS extracted from the clean mel-spectrogram X0 for each training data. For guidance,
we average and normalize the speaker embeddings of untranscribed speech for the desired speaker
_S to extract eS._

**return X0**

Initially, we scaled classifier gradient ∇Xt log pφ(ˆy|Xt, spk = S) in Eq. (8) using gradient scale s,
which is the scaled version of Song et al. (2021b). However, when guiding the unconditional DDPM
with the framewise phoneme classifier, we found that the norm of the unconditional score suddenly
increases near the data. That is, the closer to the data, the phoneme classifier has little effect on
the generative process of DDPM. The norm of unconditional score ∥∇Xt log pθ(Xt)∥ according to
timestep t is shown in Fig. 4 of Appendix A.4. Here, we propose norm-based guidance to guide
the unconditional DDPM better in terms of generating speech conditioned on frame-level phoneme
label ˆy. Norm-based guidance is a method of scaling the norm of the classifier gradient in proportion
to the norm of the score in order to prevent the effect of the gradient from being insignificant as the
score rises steeply. The ratio between the norm of the scaled gradient and the norm of the score is
defined as the gradient scale s. By adjusting s, we can determine how much the classifier gradient
contributes to the guidance of unconditional DDPM. We also introduced the temperature parameter
_τ when guiding the DDPM. We observed that tuning τ to a value greater than 1 helps generate_
high-quality mel-spectrograms.

4 EXPERIMENTS

**Datasets For experiments using a transcribed single dataset, we train our unconditional DDPM and**
phoneme classifier respectively on speech-only LJSpeech (Ito (2017)) and speech-transcript paired


-----

LJSpeech to match the settings of baseline TTS models. In addition, since our method makes use of
a set of separately trained unconditional DDPM and phoneme classifier, they can also be trained with
different datasets respectively. Here, by training the unconditional DDPM with a speech-only target
speaker dataset and the phoneme classifier with a transcribed large-scale multi-speaker dataset, we
can build a high-quality TTS model from any specific speaker dataset without any transcript. For
the corresponding experiments, we use only the speech data from LJSpeech, Hi-Fi TTS (Bakhturina
et al. (2021)), and Blizzard 2013 (King & Karaiskos (2013)) for training unconditional DDPMs,
and LibriTTS (Zen et al. (2019)), a large-scale multi-speaker dataset with approximately 585 hours
of speech uttered by 2456 speakers with corresponding texts, for training the speaker-dependent
phoneme classifier to guide the various unconditional generative models. To extract the speaker
embedding eS from each utterance, we train a speaker encoder on VoxCeleb2 (Chung et al. (2018)),
which is a speaker verification dataset that contains more than 1M utterances for 6112 speakers.

LJSpeech is a 24-hour single female speaker dataset consisting of 13,100 audio clips. Dataset is
randomly split; 12,500 samples for the training set, 100 samples for the validation set, and 500
samples for the test set. Hi-Fi TTS is a multi-speaker dataset with 6 females and 4 males, and each
speaker’s data consists of at least 17 hours of speech. We select three of them (two males and one
female) and use them for training three unconditional DDPMs, respectively. Blizzard 2013 is an 147
hours segmented and unsegmented audiobook data read by a single female speaker. We only use
5-second randomly clipped audio of unsegmented data to show that our model does not require text
labeling or aligning for untranscribed data. Only audio files are used to train unconditional DDPM.

**Training Details We convert text into International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) phoneme sequences us-**
ing open-source software (Bernard (2021)). To extract the mel-spectrogram, we use the same hyperparameters as Glow-TTS (Kim et al. (2020)). All modules are trained using Adam optimizer with a
learning rate of 0.0001. For the unconditional model and the phoneme classifier, β0 = 0.05, β1 = 20
are used for beta schedule. For unconditional model, the base model has the same architecture and
hyperparameters as DDPM (Ho et al. (2020)) used for 32 × 32 sized image modeling, and for ablation, we use the same architecture and hyperparameters for the small model as Grad-TTS (Popov
et al. (2021)). Other details and hyperparameters are described in the Appendix A.2.

**Evaluation To compare the performance of models, we use pre-trained models and the official**
implementations of Glow-TTS and Grad-TTS.[2] For Glow-TTS, we use a pre-trained model with
blank tokens between phonemes and use τ = 1.5. We use the same hyperparameters as the official
implementation, τ = 1.5, and the number of reverse steps N = 50 for Grad-TTS. For our model,
we set τ = 1.5, gradient scale s = 0.3, and the number of reverse steps N = 50. We use official
implementation and pre-trained models of HiFi-GAN as a vocoder.[3]

To show whether Guided-TTS with the norm-based guidance generates the sentences of the given
text accurately, we measure the character error rate (CER) and word error rate (WER) for each
model, which are metrics commonly used in automatic speech recognition (ASR). We use the pretrained CTC-based conformer (Graves et al. (2006), Gulati et al. (2020)) model provided by NEMO
toolkit (Kuchaiev et al. (2019)) to compute the metrics.

5 RESULTS

5.1 MODEL COMPARISON

We compare the performance of audio samples by measuring the 5-scale mean opinion score (MOS)
on LJSpeech using Amazon Mechanical Turk. In addition, through CER and WER, we check
whether the generated sample of Guided-TTS faithfully reflects the text. To calculate CER and
WER, we first synthesize the speech of a given text for each model and provide it to the ASR model
to extract the text corresponding to the generated sample. We then measure the CER and WER
between the ground truth text and the text obtained from the ASR model. For evaluation, we randomly select 50 samples drawn from the test set of LJSpeech, and the results are shown in Table
1.[4] In Table 1, Guided-TTS-T (T:Transcribed) is specified for the case of training the unconditional

DDPM and the other modules on the speech data of the target speaker. The quality of Guided-TTS-T
on LJSpeech shows that our model achieves TTS performance comparative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the ASR metrics of Guided-TTS-T indicate that our model generates speech samples
according to given text stably like the existing TTS models do. Unlike Grad-TTS, which leverages
the conditional DDPM for TTS, our unconditional DDPM requires a large model size for modeling long-term dependency of speech without text. The qualitative results of Guided-TTS-T with the
small unconditional model (Guided-TTS-T (small)), whose architecture is the same as the decoder
of Grad-TTS, demonstrate the importance of modeling capability of unconditional DDPM for the
naturalness of the samples and accurate pronunciation.

Guided-TTS-U (U:Untranscribed) is the case that we train unconditional DDPM using only the target speaker’s text-free speech and guide it using a speaker-dependent phoneme classifier separately
trained on LibriTTS. Guided-TTS-U shows performance and ASR metrics comparable to other TTS
models, which require transcribed data of the desired speaker for training. This demonstrates that
Guided-TTS enables building a high-quality TTS model using the untranscribed speech of the target
speaker. Samples of all models are available on the demo page.

model whose phoneme classifier and duration predictor are trained using the transcript of LJSpeech.

5.2 GENERALIZATION TO DIVERSE DATASETS

We show that our model can synthesize high-quality speech of LJSpeech using untranscribed speech
in the previous section. Since our model trains the unconditional model and the classifier separately,
TTS for various untranscribed datasets is possible with a single classifier trained with a large-scale
paired multi-speaker dataset. The performance of our multiple TTS models using the untranscribed
speech of target speaker is presented in Table 2. For evaluation, we used the same 50 randomly chosen sentences from the test set of LJSpeech. In Table 2, we show that if we have the phoneme classifier, duration predictor, and speaker encoder trained on a large-scale multi-speaker dataset, we can


-----

build a TTS model using untranscribed speech data of any speaker without additional burdens such
as transcription and segmentation. In particular, Guided-TTS-U synthesizes high-quality samples
even when trained on a randomly cropped unsegmented Blizzard 2013 dataset. Our method enables
TTS for diverse untranscribed datasets with various characteristics (e.g., gender, American/British
accent, prosody). There are samples on the demo page for diverse datasets.

5.3 ANALYSIS ON NORM-BASED GUIDANCE

We also compare the proposed norm-based classifier guidance with the classifier guidance used
in previous works (Song et al. (2021b); Dhariwal & Nichol (2021)). A model that performs the
conditional generation task with classifier guidance sometimes generates samples of conditions
other than the target condition (Song et al. (2021b)). Similarly, we observe that Guided-TTS with
the previous guidance method produces mispronounced samples given text. To show the effect of
norm-based guidance and adjustment of gradient scale, we measure CER of Guided-TTS-T and
Guided-TTS-U for LJSpeech according to the gradient scale s. We explore the gradient scale s
within [0.5, 1.0, ..., 4.5] for the scaled version of the previous method (Song et al. (2021b)), and

[0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0] for the norm-based guidance.

proposed norm-based guidance. As shown in Fig. 2a, the sample generated by the existing guidance
method shows a far worse CER than the existing TTS models, which indicates that it is not suitable
for TTS. On the other hand, Fig. 2b shows that the proposed guidance method with the appropriate
gradient scale helps generate samples given text sentences accurately like the existing TTS models.

If the gradient scale is too small, the effect of the classifier gradient is negligible, and generated
samples do not reflect the given text. On the other hand, we observed that guidance with a gradient
scale too large deteriorates the sample quality. For the proposed norm-based guidance, we set the
default gradient scale s to 0.3, which generates high-quality samples that exactly match the given
text. Samples for multiple gradient scales with each guidance method are on the demo page.

6 RELATED WORK

**Unconditional Speech Generation In general, the unconditional speech generative model (van den**
Oord et al. (2016); Vasquez & Lewis (2019)), which models audio without any information, is
more challenging than the conditional generative model that synthesizes speech using text or melspectrograms. Several works attempt to unconditionally generate raw waveforms (van den Oord
et al. (2016); Donahue et al. (2019)) or to model the unconditional distribution of latent code or
mel-spectrogram of audio (van den Oord et al. (2017); Vasquez & Lewis (2019)) instead of directly
modeling raw waveforms. Most existing unconditional models have only been used for unconditional audio modeling and no other purpose. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first applica

tion of an unconditional model for TTS with appropriate guidance to enable speech synthesis using
untranscribed data of the target speaker.

**Text-to-Speech Models Most text-to-speech (TTS) models are composed of two parts: a model**
that generates intermediate features (e.g., mel-spectrogram) from text (Shen et al. (2018)) and the
vocoder, which synthesizes raw waveforms from intermediate features (van den Oord et al. (2016)).
The autoregressive model is used for the text-to-intermediate feature model (Wang et al. (2017);
Shen et al. (2018); Ping et al. (2018); Li et al. (2019)) and vocoder (van den Oord et al. (2016);
Kalchbrenner et al. (2018)) to perform high-quality TTS. Since the autoregressive models generate
samples in a sequential manner, their inference speed is slow. Thus, various parallel TTS models have been proposed to improve the sampling speed. Flow-based generative models (Kingma &
Dhariwal (2018)) and feed-forward models have been proposed for text-to-mel-spectrogram models
(Ren et al. (2019); Ren et al. (2021); Kim et al. (2020); Shih et al. (2021)) and vocoders (Oord et al.
(2018); Prenger et al. (2019); Kim et al. (2019)). Also, variational autoencoder (Kingma & Welling
(2014)) based models (Lee et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2021)), diffusion (Ho et al. (2020)) based models
(Chen et al. (2021a); Kong et al. (2021); Popov et al. (2021); Jeong et al. (2021)), GAN (Goodfellow
et al. (2014)) based models (Kumar et al. (2019); Bi´nkowski et al. (2019); Kong et al. (2020)) have
been proposed as high-quality speech synthesis models with parallel sampling schemes.

Recently, end-to-end TTS models have been proposed, such as Ren et al. (2021), Donahue et al.
(2021), Weiss et al. (2021), Kim et al. (2021), and Chen et al. (2021b). Most previous TTS models
perform conditional generation tasks using transcribed speech data of the target speaker. We propose
a new TTS model that learns to generate speech of the target speaker using untranscribed data and
guides it through a phoneme classifier trained with other transcribed datasets. By guiding the unconditional model with the independently trained classifier, we achieve a high-performance TTS model
using untranscribed data of the desired speaker without sentence-level segmentation or transcription.

**Diffusion-based Generative Models DDPM (Ho et al. (2020)) has undergone several theoretical**
developments (Song et al. (2021b)) and produces high quality samples in many domains (Ho et al.
(2020); Dhariwal & Nichol (2021); Chen et al. (2021a); Popov et al. (2021); Luo & Hu (2021)).
Many theoretical and practical breakthroughs (Nichol & Dhariwal (2021); Lam et al. (2021); Chen
et al. (2021a); Song et al. (2021a); Watson et al. (2021); Kong & Ping (2021); Jolicoeur-Martineau
et al. (2021)) have been proposed, and a continuous version of DDPM, an SDE-based model (Song
et al. (2021b); Popov et al. (2021)) is also presented. DDPM has also shown strong performance in
speech synthesis (Chen et al. (2021a); Kong et al. (2021); Popov et al. (2021); Jeong et al. (2021)).

A pre-trained unconditional DDPM can be used for various tasks such as imputation (Song et al.
(2021b)), and controllable generation (Song et al. (2021b)). In particular, the controllable generation allows Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in class-conditional
image generation by guiding the DDPM using a gradient from the classifier trained on the same
dataset as DDPM. We introduce the classifier guidance method of unconditional DDPM to text-tospeech synthesis. Our unconditional DDPM and the phoneme classifier can be trained using different
datasets, making it possible to build a TTS model with the target speaker’s untranscribed speech.

7 CONCLUSION

In this work, we present Guided-TTS, a new type of TTS model that generates speech given transcript by guiding the unconditional diffusion-based model for speech. As Guided-TTS models unconditional distribution for speech, the proposed model can construct a TTS model using the desired
speaker’s untranscribed data. Thanks to the properties of diffusion-based generative models, our
unconditional generative model can generate a speech when a transcript is given by introducing
the separately trained phoneme classifier. To the best of our knowledge, Guided-TTS is the first
TTS model to leverage the unconditional generative model for speech. We showed that Guided-TTS
matches the performance of the previous TTS models on LJSpeech. Moreover, Guided-TTS without
the transcript of the target speaker generates samples comparable to existing models using transcripts by training its phoneme classifier on a large-scale multi-speaker dataset. We also showed that
the single well-performed phoneme classifier can guide various unconditional DDPMs to generate
high-quality sample. We believe that Guided-TTS can reduce the burden of constructing training
datasets for high-quality TTS.

A APPENDIX

A.1 INPAINTING

We perform the inpainting task to show how well the unconditional DDPM learns the dependencies in mel-spectrogram. The pre-trained unconditional DDPM fills out the masked part of the
mel-spectrogram. We use samples from three speakers; one female speaker (ID: 92) and one male
speaker (ID: 6097) from Hi-Fi TTS and a female speaker from LJSpeech. Two cross-shaped masks
(LJSpeech, Hi-Fi TTS male) and one binarized MNIST (LeCun & Cortes (2010)) mask (Hi-Fi TTS
female) are used for masking. We set 1000 as the number of reverse steps N and τ = 1.5 for
inpainting. The method of inpainting is the same as Song et al. (2021b), and the algorithm is as
follows:

we show that our unconditional DDPM learns the adjacent frequency and temporal dependencies of
the mel-spectrogram. Samples of inpainting results are provided on the demo page.

A.2 TRAINING DETAILS AND HYPERPARAMTERS

In this section, we cover the training details and detailed hyperparameters. In Guided-TTS-T, all
modules are trained on LJSpeech. In Guided-TTS-U, we use only untranscribed data of the various
target speakers for training unconditional DDPMs and train a phoneme classifier and a duration


-----

predictor on LibriTTS. Alignment labels are required for training the phoneme classifier and the
duration predictor, and we train MFA to extract the alignment using the same dataset used to train
the phoneme classifier and duration predictor.

For both Guided-TTS-T and Guided-TTS-U, the unconditional models are trained with batch size
16 for all datasets. The duration predictor is trained for 20 epochs with batch size 64. The phoneme
classifier of Guided-TTS-T uses a WaveNet-like structure with 256 residual channels, 6 residual
blocks stacks of 3 dilated convolution layers, and is trained for 1000 epochs with batch size 64. For
Guided-TTS-U, we use a WaveNet-like structure with 512 residual channels, 3 residual blocks stacks
of 6 dilated convolution layers for the phoneme classifier, and it is trained for 140 epochs with batch
size 64. The speaker encoder is a two-layer LSTM with 768 channels followed by a linear projection
layer to extract 256-dimensional speaker embedding eS, and trained for 300K iterations.

For sampling, we use the last checkpoint for the unconditional DDPM and the speaker encoder. We
use the checkpoint of the epoch with the best metric for the phoneme classifier (validation accuracy)
and the duration predictor (validation loss).

A.3 HARDWARE AND SAMPLING SPEED

We conduct all experiments and evaluations using NVIDIA’s RTX 8000 with 48GB memory. Although our model is not focused on fast inference, Guided-TTS can perform real-time speech synthesis on GPU for N = 50, which is the number of reverse steps we use for evaluation. We measure
the sampling speed of Guided-TTS using a real-time factor (RTF). We also measure how much
time it takes to compute the unconditional score (∇Xt log pθ(Xt)) and gradient of the classifier
(∇Xt log pφ(ˆy|Xt)). Guided-TTS-T achieves an RTF of 0.56, of which 0.39 is used to calculate the
score and 0.16 is used for classifier gradient calculation. Similarly, Guided-TTS-U achieves an RTF
of 0.63, 0.39 for computing the score and 0.23 for computing the gradient of the classifier.

The norm of the unconditional score and the gradient norm of the classifier for each timestep are
shown in Fig. 4. We sample Xt at a total of 1000 timesteps (t ∈ ( 20001 _[,]_ 20003 _[, ...,][ 1999]2000_ [))][ using the]

Eq. (3) for all 500 samples from the test set of the LJSpeech. We then obtain the norm of the

Guided-TTS-T. Each norm is averaged over 500 samples for each timestep. As shown in Fig. 4a,
the norm of the unconditional score rises steeply around t = 0. This is about 70 times larger than
the norm of the classifier gradient near t = 0 (Fig. 4b), which significantly reduces the effect of
the classifier guidance. To alleviate this problem, we propose the norm-based guidance in Section
3.2.1, which helps prevent both the gradient of the classifier from being ignored and the issue of
synthesized speech not matching the text.
