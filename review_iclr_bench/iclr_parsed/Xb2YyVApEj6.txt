Paper under double-blind review

ABSTRACT

Though image transformers have shown competitive results with convolutional
neural networks in computer vision tasks, lacking inductive biases such as locality still poses problems in terms of model efficiency especially for embedded
applications. In this work, we address this issue by introducing attention masks
to incorporate spatial locality into self-attention heads. Local dependencies are
captured with masked attention heads along with global dependencies captured
by original unmasked attention heads. With Masked attention image Transformer
– MaiT, top-1 accuracy increases by up to 2.5% compared to DeiT, without extra
parameters/FLOPs, or external training data. Moreover, attention masks regulate
the training of attention maps, which facilitates the convergence and improves the
accuracy of deeper transformers. Masked attention heads guide the model to focus on local information in early layers and promote diverse attention maps in
latter layers. Deep MaiT improves the top-1 accuracy by up to 1.7% compared to
CaiT with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Encoding locality with attention masks
requires no extra parameter or structural change, and thus it can be combined with
other techniques for further improvement in vision transformers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016; Tan & Le, 2019)
have been the de facto model for computer vision (CV) tasks, which are inherently equipped with
inductive biases such as translation equivariance and locality. Recently, vision transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Touvron et al., 2021a) are gaining momentum translating the success from
transformer-based models in natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin
et al., 2019). Self-attention heads excel at capturing the long-range dependencies in sequences but
struggle at focusing on local information. Unlike CNNs which have gone through many iterations
of optimization, vision transformers are not very efficient and still require huge computing power
and a large number of Flops.

Naturally, combining the benefits of both CNNs and vision transformers is promising to further
boost performances of CV models. The question remains how to effectively integrate inductive bias
such as spatial locality into transformers. One direction is to utilize convolutional blocks to extract
spatial information by adapting either the patch-token embedding layer, self-attention module or
feed-forward layers, to form CNN-transformer hybrid structures as in Li et al. (2021b); Srinivas et al.
(2021); Graham et al. (2021); Wu et al. (2021a); Yuan et al. (2021a); Guo et al. (2021). However,
forcefully inserting convolutional operations into transformers may potentially constrain the learning
capacity of transformers.

To capture the spatial information without significantly changing the transformer model architecture,
Chu et al. (2021b) introduce extra positional encoding. Han et al. (2021); Chen et al. (2021) fuse
local and global representations using multiple transformer blocks or branches to simultaneously
process images at different scales such as pixel-level, small-patch or large patch. Yuan et al. (2021b)
apply a layerwise tokens-to-tokens transformation to capture local structure. These approaches usually come with the cost of extra parameters and model complexity, thus potentially lowering the
inference speed.

d’Ascoli et al. (2021); Zhou et al. (2021) improve the self-attention for better representation with
gated positional self-attention and learnable transformation matrix respectively. Hu et al. (2019),

Ramachandran et al. (2019) adapt the self-attention module and improve the performance of CNN
models. Liu et al. (2021) captures locality within shifted windows in a hierarchical structure. Though
it could save computation in some cases, the added model complexity may lower its potentials.

Different from prior works, we try to incorporate spatial locality without changing its architecture or
adding extra parameters/FLOPs. We propose attention masks to guide the attention heads to focus on
local information. Masked attention heads extract local dependencies more efficiently by allowing
information aggregation only from the closest neighbors. This liberates other unmasked heads to
learn global information more effectively. We name the modified model, Masked attention image
Transformer (MaiT), which is built on top of DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021a). MaiT gathers both
local and global information at the same time from different heads. Moreover, the regularization
effects from attention masks facilitate the training of deep transformers by guiding the attention
map learning and promoting diversity across transformer layers.

We proved that less is more in this specific case with attention masks. MaiT achieves up to 2.5%
higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) with the same model architecture as DeiT
(Touvron et al., 2021a). Additionally, deep MaiT outperforms CaiT (Touvron et al., 2021b) by up to
1.7% in top-1 accuracy with fewer parameters and simpler structure.

In summary, we make three major contributions in this work: 1). we propose attention masks
to encode the spatial locality into self-attention heads without structural change or extra parameter/computation, while improving model efficiency. 2). We present a quick empirical search strategy for the masking scheme exploration, along with an automatic end-to-end search alternative. 3).
We also reveal the importance of the locality across layers and the performance impact of attention masks on deep vision transformers. Note though MaiT is demonstrated with DeiT/CaiT, the
attention mask is applicable to other vision transformers as well.

2 RELATED WORK

Spatial locality is an integral part of the convolutional operation with weight filters attending to local
regions of input feature maps. Vision transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) is the first pure
transformer-based model on vision tasks, but it requires a large private labeled dataset JFT300M
(Sun et al., 2017) to achieve competitive performances. Data-efficient image transformer (DeiT)
(Touvron et al., 2021a) improves upon ViT models by introducing stronger data augmentation, regularization, and knowledge distillation. Class-attention in image transformer (CaiT) (Touvron et al.,
2021b) extends DeiT by increasing the number of transformer layers. To overcome the difficulties of
training deeper transformers, CaiT introduces LayerScale and class-attention layers, which increase
the parameters and model complexity.

Tokens-to-Token vision transformer (T2T) (Yuan et al., 2021b) proposes an image transformation
by recursive token aggregation to capture local structure. Stand-alone self-attention (Ramachandran
et al., 2019) applies local self-attention layer to replace spatial convolution and outperform original
ResNet models. Even though sharing value and key spatially is parameter efficient in this approach,
content-based information is lost. Transformer-iN-Transformer (TNT) (Han et al., 2021) models
both patch-level and pixel-level representations and applies outer and inner transformer blocks to
extract global and local information respectively. ConViT (d’Ascoli et al., 2021) proposes the gated
positional self-attention to incorporate soft convolutional biases. CrossViT (Chen et al., 2021) proposes a dual-branch transformer architecture for multi-scale feature extraction.

For pixel-level prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, Pyramid Vision
Transformer (PVT) (Wang et al., 2021a) introduces a progressive shrinking pyramid and spatialreduction attention with fine-grained image patches. DETR (Carion et al., 2020) adapts transformers
for object detection tasks. Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021) applies hierarchical transformer with
shifted windows of varying sizes. Twins (Chu et al., 2021a) deploys interleaved locally-grouped
self-attention and global sub-sample attention layers to improve performances.

To optimize transformer and save computation, Wu et al. (2021b) uses centroid attention to extract
and compress input information, Jaegle et al. (2021) iteratively distill inputs into latent space with
attention bottlenecks, Wang et al. (2021b) dynamically adjusts the number of tokens with multiple cascading transformers, and Wu et al. (2020) introduced semantic token to replace pixel-based
transformers to save computation.


-----

There are hybrid architectures fusing convolutional and transformer blocks, such as LocalViT (Li
et al., 2021b), BoTNet (Srinivas et al., 2021), LeViT (Graham et al., 2021), BossNet (Li et al.,
2021a), CvT (Wu et al., 2021a), CoaT (Xu et al., 2021), CMT (Guo et al., 2021) for higher accuracy
and faster inference.

Unlike prior literature, our work explores the intrinsic capability of pure transformer block on incorporating spatial locality and the impact of the locality along the depth direction. This work is also
inspired by the emerging graph attention network (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018), borrowing the concept
of message passing and information aggregation from nearest neighbors.

Note attention masks have been used in NLP tasks as a sparsification method to reduce the computation complexity, as well as to capture local information, as in Guo et al. (2019); Child et al. (2019);
Beltagy et al. (2020); Ainslie et al. (2020).

3 VISION TRANSFORMER PRELIMINARIES

The transformer architecture introduced by Vaswani (Vaswani et al., 2017) inspired many model
variants with remarkable success in NLP tasks. ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) extends pure
transformer-based architecture into CV applications. Instead of pixel-level processing, ViT splits
the original images into a sequence of patches as inputs and transforms them into patch tokens, for
better computation efficiency. In general, ViT consists of 3 fundamental modules: embedding layer,
multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward network.

To process images in transformer, the original RGB images (224×224) is flattened into a sequence of
_N (14×14) patches. Each patch has a fixed size (typical 16x16 pixels). Patches are then transformed_
into patch embedding with hidden dimensions (D) of 192, 384, and 768 for tiny, small, and base
models respectively in ViT/DeiT. In addition to patch tokens, the embedding layer also integrates
positional information, classification and knowledge distillation through the positional token, class
token and distillation token, respectively.

Positional token is added into the patch embedding with a trainable positional embedding. However,
this positional embedding is added only in the embedding layers. The spatial information is largely
lost in the transformer layers since all-to-all attention is invariant to the order of the patches.

The class token is another trainable vector (1×D), concatenated to the patch tokens (total N +1). It
is used to collect information from the patch tokens to make output predictions, while also spreading
information among patch tokens during training.

Distillation token is sometimes added for knowledge transfer from teacher models, such as a CNN
model. When training the distilled version of the model, a distillation token is further concatenated
to the patch token along with the class token (total N +2).

Multi-head self-attention (MHA) module has multiple parallel attention heads, where each of them
comprises three main components: Key (K ), Query (Q), and Value (V ), Key and Query are trained
and multiplied to estimate how much weights on each corresponding token in Value for output:


_QK_ _T_
_Attention(K, Q, V ) = Softmax_ _√d_



(1)


Where softmax is applied to each row of the input product matrix (QK _[T]_ ) and _√d provides ap-_

propriate normalization. Multiple attention heads in MHA attend to different parts of the input
simultaneously. Considering H heads in MHA layer, the hidden dimension D is split equally across
all heads (D = H × d ).

Feed-forward network (FFN) follows after the MHA module, containing two linear transformation
layers separated by Gelu activation. The hidden dimension expands by 4x after the first linear layer
from D to 4D, and is reduced back to D in the second linear layer. Both MHA and FFN use
skip-connections with layer normalization as the residual operation.

4 MASKED ATTENTION HEAD

Spatial locality plays a crucial role in computer vision tasks. CNN models capture it using the sliding
filter of shared weights, typically with a receptive field of 3×3, 5×5, or 7×7. In contrast to CNN
models, the locality is not explicitly introduced in the transformer structure. With attention masks,
we can explicitly insert locality into self-attention modules without introducing any extra parameter
or computation. The key idea is to apply a mask on the all-to-all attention products (i.e. QK _[T]_ )
to reinforce the weights from the closest neighbors by aggregating information only from tokens
selected by the mask.

Figure 1: Attention mask with depth of 1 (orange) and 2 (green).

Figure 1 illustrates an example of our proposed masking scheme. The orange box shows a 3 × 3
mask, where only the direct neighboring patches are selected. Specifically, Patch 16 only gathers
information from the closest neighbors of Patch 1, 2, 3, 15, 17, 29, 30, and 31, and ignores the rest of
patches. This is different from the typical all-to-all attention module, where Patch 16 attends to all
0-195 patches. We can easily expand the depth of the attention mask beyond the closest neighbors,
to second-level neighbors (green box in Figure 1) or more. Note that the class token (and distillation
token) still attends to all the patches to collect and spread information during forward and backward
passes. Since each attention product selected by the mask is calculated by Q and K, the masked
attention head also retains the content-based locality information.

The attention mask is added before Softmax, regulating the distribution of attention maps to focus
more on the closest neighbors:


_M_ _QK_ _T_
_Masked Attention(K, Q, V ) = Softmax_ _⊙_

_√d_




(2)


where M ∈{0, 1}[(][N] [+1)][×][(][N] [+1)] is a binary attention mask, encoding the spatial locality into the
attention head by passing through only the weights from close neighbors and setting the rest to zero.

Note it’s important to add the mask before Softmax because it allows the model to learn the importance of the locality flexibly. More precisely, unselected patches appear as e[0] = 1 in the numerator
of the softmax operation. Thus, if the attention product result of the closest neighbors is meaningfully larger than zero (i.e. M ⊙ _QK_ _[T]_ _≫_ 0), it suggests that local information dominates. However,
if those results are negative or close to zero, it implies that local information is insignificant and
global information is more important. Therefore, inserting masks before the softmax operation al_lows models to enforce locality or bypass it._

4.1 ATTENTION LOCALITY SCORE (ALS)

The softmax operation transfers the results of QK _[T]_ into the probability space. As a result, each row
of the attention map (A) sums up to 1. For each patch, the probability of focusing on local neighbors
equals the sum of their neighbors’ attention map weights. If this number approaches one, the local
information is crucial; whereas if it is close to zero, it means global information matters more. For

column index of the attention map respectively. We later use the ALS metric to get some insights 
about the locality behavior of different attention heads at various layers in our models.

4.2 MASKING STRATEGY

With total H attention heads, h[′] number of attention heads can be allocated to focus on local information. The rest of the unaltered attention heads (H − _h[′]) capture global dependencies. Therefore,_
we can extract the local information through masked attention heads and global information through
original attention heads at the same time, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Masked attention heads and original attention heads for local and global dependencies.

Besides the depth of the attention mask, the number of masked attention heads in MHA and the
position (which layer to insert mask) are also hyper-parameters. Though masks encode locality
into the attention heads, the regularization from masking (pruning attention map) can also limit the
learning capacity. Consequently, where to add attention masks requires careful consideration. The
complexity to search for the best masking strategy is up to 2[36] for a 12-layer model with 3 heads.
Thus for a quick empirical search to obtain a decent mask placement within 2-3 training iterations,
we leverage the insights from ALS study in Section 5.4 and follow a masking strategy below:

1. Initialization: add mask to only one attention head (Head 0) for all layers to explicitly
introduce locality in every layer (forming a local path from the beginning to the end)

2. Assignment: compute ALS[0][,l] for every layer l

(a) If ALS[0][,l] is close to 1: add masks to all attention heads of layer l, proceed to 3

(b) If ALS[0][,l] is close to 0.5: keep the mask, add no more

(c) If ALS[0][,l] is close to 0: remove the mask

3. Calibration: following 2.a), compute ALS[h,l] for each head and remove the mask if
_ALS[h,l]_ is close to 0


Note that optimal masking is a large space as opposed to a single unique placement. The model is
capable of adjusting to different masking schemes flexibly. Step 2 (a) relies on the observations that
early layers (typically with ALS close to 1) focus heavily on local features and thus more masked
heads are beneficial. Step 3 will remove the redundant mask accordingly.

4.3 SOFT MASKING

To alleviate the complicated searching problem and automatically learn the mask placement, we
introduce a learnable scale factor α ∈ (0, 1) for each attention head. We name this approach Soft


-----

Masking, which replaces the zeros in the original masks with scale factors and keeps the ones. The
binary masking approach is named Hard Masking.

1 if j is n’s close neighbor 1 if j is n’s close neighbor
_Mn,j =_ _n,j_ [=] (4)
0 if j is not n’s close neighbor [vs.][ M][ ′] _α_ if j is not n’s close neighbor
 

where Mn,j, Mn,j[′] [is the n-th row and j-th column element in the hard and soft mask respectively.]

This scale factor penalizes the attention weights from non-neighboring patches. It allows non-local
patch tokens to contribute differently. When α approaches 0, this attention head focuses more on
local information. Otherwise when it’s close to 1, the attention head attends global information. As
a result, each attention head at every layer is able to flexibly determine the importance of locality.
Note, this introduces negligible extra parameters during training. For example, it only introduces 36
extra parameters for a 12-layer MaiT tiny model with 3 heads.

5 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we report the results for MaiT, implemented by applying attention masks on top of
DeiT. We evaluate the impact of different hyper parameters related to the masking scheme including
the mask depth, number of masked heads per layer, and number of transformer layers. We also
analyze the importance of locality in the depth direction and the performance impact of masks for
deep transformers. We merely focus on models with fewer than 50M parameters, which are more
applicable to embedded systems and mobile devices.

5.1 SETUP

We follow the same training procedure as DeiT, unless specified otherwise. The implementation
is based on the Timm library (Wightman, 2019). Models are trained with ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet
dataset (Deng et al., 2009) with the default batch size of 1024 on 4 GPUs for 300 epochs for 12-layer
models and 400 epochs for models with more than 12 layers. The model parameters we adopted is
summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Details of MaiT model parameters

**Model** **Extra tiny (XT)** **Tiny (T)** **Extra small (XS)** **Small (S)**

Hidden dim. 144 192 288 384
Heads 3 3 3 6

5.2 IMPACT OF MASK DEPTH

Intuitively, the field of view is larger with an attention mask of larger depth, to gather broader
neighborhood information. However, in the extreme case with mask depth of N +1 (standard selfattention), all the patch token information is merged and positional information is lost. Nevertheless,
considering the pruning effect from the mask, a smaller depth for the attention mask potentially
translates to fewer FLOPs, which might be useful for some hardware devices such as embedded
CPUs. For example, with the 3×3 mask, we only compute 9 out of all (N +1) attention weights for
each token. When N =196, this saves 95% of attention map computation.

To study the impact of the mask depth, we mask only one attention head for every MHA module,
with the field of view as 3×3, 3×5, and 5×5 on tiny and small DeiT models. The results are
summarized in Table 2. There is 0.1 - 0.3 % improvement compared to DeiT small. Various mask
sizes only lead to marginal differences in accuracy. This is probably because each patch (original
16x16 pixels) is a processed sub-image and already contains some locality information, and thus
further away patch tokens barely provide much extra information. Therefore, 3x3 mask is the default
setting for MaiT in the subsequent sections.

In contrast to DeiT, whose accuracy saturates beyond 300 epochs as reported in (Touvron et al.,
2021a), MaiT-small sees another 1.1% improvement when trained for 400 epochs. Accordingly, we

Small 79.8 79.9(+0.1) 80.1(+0.3) 80.0(+0.2) 80.9(+1.1)

suspect a higher learning rate and lower drop path rate are beneficial for MaiT-tiny since attention
masks already provide some regulation during training. Changing the batch size from 1024 to 3072
only results in small gain of 0.4% for MaiT-tiny with 3×3 mask. In comparison, adopting 0 drop
path rate and 2× learning rate, we obtain 2.5% improvement over DeiT-T.

5.3 IMPACT OF MASKING STRATEGY

We compare the performances of 24-layer MaiT models with the following three representative
masking schemes (Sch.), to quantify the impact of the masking strategy. Sch.1 is a naive way to
combine local and global information at every layer. Sch.2 results from the masking strategy in
Section 4.2. Sch.3 is based on the soft masking.

**Sch.1: one masked head for all 24 layers**

**Sch.2: Masked heads for Layer 0-7 is H-1, Layer 9-19 is one, and Layer 20-23 is none**

**Sch.3: Soft masking for Layer 0-20, no mask for Layer 21-23**

Table 3: Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for 24-layer DeiT and MaiT with different masking schemes.
Sch.1 adopts only one masked head. Sch.2 applies a mixed masking and Sch.3 uses soft masking.

**DeiT** **MaiT(Sch.1)** **MaiT(Sch.2)** **MaiT(Sch.3)**

Tiny 78.3 79.1 79.1 79.3
Extra Small -  81.0 81.4 81.3

As shown in Table 3, top-1 accuracy improves by 0.8% simply through adopting one masked head
for MaiT-T. Another 0.4% improvement is achieved with mixed masking for MaiT-XS. Soft masking
further increases the accuracy by 0.2% for MaiT-T. Note that the initialization of the scale factor for
MaiT-XS is subject to further tuning.

Empirically we find Sch.2 yields relative good performances by masking heavily in the first onethird of layers to extract local features and only one mask for the middle layers. Note that there is a
tradeoff between computation complexity and accuracy with hard masking and soft masking. Hard
masking can translate to linear increase for attention map computation with respect to the number
of tokens N, or O(N ), if hardware can leverage the structured sparsity. This is especially beneficial
with high resolution images with a large number of tokens. The computation complexity remains
quadratic as O(N [2]) for soft masking.

5.4 IMPORTANCE OF SPATIAL LOCALITY

Attention Locality Score (ALS) provides a quantitative metric to study the importance of spatial
locality for each head across all layers. Figure 3 a) illustrates the result of a 24-layer MaiT-Tiny
with one masked head. ALS of the masked head is significantly higher than other heads in Layer
0-22. This indicates the model learns to focus more on local information with the masked attention
head. ALS gradually declines from around 90% for the first 8 layers down to around 60% and below
5% for the last layer. Note ALS of the last layer is below 0.0051 (1/(N +1) = 1/197), an average
score if the attention weights are distributed uniformly. This suggests that spatial locality is largely
ignored in the last layer where global information is more important.


-----

Similarly, when learning the masking automatically through soft masking (Figure3 b)), the first 8
layers show over 0.9 ALS for multiple heads and layers. ALS gradually decreases in the middle
layer with at most one head focusing heavily on local features. ALS is below 0.3 for the last 10
layers, where all heads tend to global information.

Overall, the spatial locality is more important in the early layers, and its importance gradually declines in deeper layer, which is consistent with d’Ascoli et al. (2021), Raghu et al. (2021)

Figure 3: Attention Locality Scores (ALS) for MaiT-Tiny: a) one masked head for all 24 layers; b)
soft masking for all 24 layers

5.5 DEEPER TRANSFORMERS

Another difficulty is to train deeper models because naively stacking transformer layers fails to
deliver the expected performance gain as shown in Touvron et al. (2021b). One reason is attention
collapse, i.e. the attention maps are more alike among deeper layers (Zhou et al., 2021). We find
mixed masking is able to break the structural repetition in deep transformers and promotes diversity
in later layers.

Figure 4: Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for DeiT (red), MaiT (green), CaiT (yellow) and randomly
masked DeiT (blue) with various numbers of transformer blocks. Green square MaiT applies one
mask heads for all layers while green star MaiT masks all three heads for the first 12 layers and only
one masked attention head for the rest 24 layers.

Performances of DeiT start to saturate after reaching certain depth. For example, increasing the
number layers from 24 to 36, top-1 accuracy only increases by 0.25% for DeiT-tiny (Figure 4). In
contrast, MaiT with mixed masking boosts the accuracy to 79.8%, extending the performance gain
with deeper transformers. Interestingly, we noticed that for 24-layer model, CaiT is even worse than
naively stacked DeiT-24, suggesting that the hyper-parameters for 24-layer CaiT-tiny are probably
not optimal.


-----

To rule out the pure pruning effects on attention maps from masking, we also apply a random mask
of the same drop-out rate to one head of all 24 layers. The randomly masked model leads to 0.5%
accuracy drop compared to 24-layer DeiT. This provides further proof that the performance gain
with attention masks is indeed from better spatial locality aggregation.

To better understand the impact of attention masks in deep MaiT, we compare the cross layer similarity heat map among 36 layers of DeiT, MaiT (one masked head), and MaiT (mixed masking) in
Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9 respectively. Effective masking lowers the cross-layer similarity
and thus improves scalability of MaiT .

5.6 COMPARISON WITH OTHER STATE OF THE ART VISION TRANSFORMERS

Attention mask can be easily combined with other optimization techniques. For deep transformers, we adopt the LayerScale (Touvron et al., 2021b) to MaiT as MaiT*. As shown in Table 4,
MaiT/MaiT* obtain competitive performances across different model sizes. Specifically, MaiT-T
outperforms CaiT-T by 1.7%. MaiT-S* achieves 0.2% higher accuracy than CaiT-S with less parameters/FLOPs and simpler structure, which translates to higher throughput. Moreover, simply adding
the attention mask to CaiT leads to 0.5% and 0.2% higher accuracy for tiny and smaller models
respectively.

6 CONCLUSION

In this work, we incorporate spatial locality into vision transformers by inserting masks to attention
heads. Masked heads are able to focus on local information and liberate other unmasked heads
to extract global information more effectively. We also introduce attention locality score to guide
the mask search and rapidly evaluate various masking schemes. Attention masking is a simple and
effective technique, especially for small and deep transformer models. We observe that attention
masks also serve as a regularizer to guide the training of attention maps for deeper transformers.
Moreover, it is promising to further boost performances by combining this attention mask technique
with other optimization approaches.

A.1 HYPER PARAMETERS FOR MAIT

Table 5: Hyper parameters for 24-layer MaiT in Table 4. Drop rate refers to linear stochastic depth
drop rate, the same as in Touvron et al. (2021a). *denotes the constant drop out for all layers as in
Touvron et al. (2021b)

**Model** **Drop rate** **Batch size** **Learning rate**

MaiT-XT 0.0 1024 0.001×batchsize/512
MaiT-T 0.05 1024 0.001×batchsize/512
MaiT-XS 0.1 1024 0.0005×batchsize/512
MaiT-S 0.1* 1024 0.0005×batchsize/512

A.2 ALS OF DEIT AND DEEP MAIT

Figure 5: ALS for 24-layer DeiT tiny.

When trained without restriction from attention masks, DeiT emphasizes the locality in the first 8
layers with over 0.8 ALS for some heads, as shown in Figure 5. In comparison, in Figure 3, MaiT
utilizes masked Head 0 to extract local information and ALS is lower for unmasked Head 1 and
Head 2.

Figure 6: ALS of deeper MaiT-tiny with 12, 24 and 36 layers.

When the number of transformer blocks increases, the importance of locality expands to deeper
layers as shown in Figure 6. For the masked Head 0 in MaiT-tiny, 12-layer model shows more than
0.8 ALS for 6 layers out of the first 7 layers, the following 4 layers give a ALS around 0.5, and the
ALS of the last layer declines below 0.05. Likewise, for 24-layer and 36 layer models, 10 layers out
of the first 12 layers show ALS higher than 0.8, and decreases to 0.5 or 0.6 in the following layers
before the last layer.

A.3 CROSS-LAYER SIMILARITY

To evaluate the impact of attention masks on the diversity of the attention maps across all layers, we
apply a cross-layer similarity metric similarly defined in DeepViT (Zhou et al., 2021):

_Mh,t[i,j]_ [=] **A[i]h,t,:[A][j]h,t,[⊤]** : (5)

_∥A[i]h,t,:[∥∥][A][i]h,t,:[∥]_

where Mh,t[i,j] [is the attention map cosine similarity between layer i and layer j for attention head h and]
token t. Ah,t,: measures the weight contribution for each token in input (Value) for output token T.
Therefore, it reflects the similarity of attention maps on information aggregation across all T input
tokens. For example, if Mh,t[i,j] [reaches 1, output token t at head h attends to all N+1 tokens in Value]
with the same probability for both layer i and layer j.

DeiT shows the highest cross-layer similarity at the last 8 stages, with an average of 0.75 (Figure 7).
This homogeneity in attention maps at the late stage limits the model learning capability. Adding
mask to one head for all 36 layers does not alleviate this problem since the same structure is repeated
36 times in the model. As a result, the average cross-layer similarity for the last 8 layers with
unmasked heads is also 0.75 (Figure 8). Alternatively, if we mask all heads in the first 8 layers, they
are naturally different from the rest of the partially masked layers, and the same structure is only
repeated 8 or 24 times. As shown in Figure 9, cross-layer similarity between the first 8 layers and
the following 24 layer are mostly well below 0.3 for Head 1 and 2. Additionally, a mixed masking
scheme lower the cross-layer similarity among the last 8 layers by 0.1 to 0.65.

Figure 7: Attention map similarity across 36 layers for DeiT-tiny

In Figure 7, 36-layer DeiT-tiny shows the highest similarity at the last 8 stages across all three
heads, with an average similarity of 0.75, whereas the similarity is quite small among the first 16
layers and between the first 16 layers and the last 20 layers. This is agreement with Zhou et al.
(2021), indicating an attention collapse at later stage of deep transformers.

In comparison, for MaiT with one masked head across all layers, the masked attention Head 0
shows a more uniform distribution with a lower peak intensity as compared to the the non-masked
or partially masked (in early layers) Head 1 and Head 2 (Figure 8. For unmasked Head 1 and Head
2, later stage especially the last 8 layers show highest similarity among each other, the average of
them is also 0.75. This suggests one masked head for all transformer blocks is not as effective in
36-layer model as in 24-layer model. This indicates repeating the same structure for 36 times in the

depth direction is causing the attention collapse. The diversity among the heads within the same
layer doesn’t alleviate this issue.
