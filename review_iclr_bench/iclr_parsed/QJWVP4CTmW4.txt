Face clustering has attracted rising research interest recently to take advantage
of massive amounts of face images on the web. State-of-the-art performance has
been achieved by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) due to their powerful
representation capacity. However, existing GCN-based methods build face graphs
mainly according to kNN relations in the feature space, which may lead to a lot
of noise edges connecting two faces of different classes. The face features will be
polluted when messages pass along these noise edges, thus degrading the performance of GCNs. In this paper, a novel algorithm named Ada-NETS is proposed to
cluster faces by constructing clean graphs for GCNs. In Ada-NETS, each face is
transformed to a new structure space, obtaining robust features by considering face
features of the neighbour images. Then, an adaptive neighbour discovery strategy
is proposed to determine a proper number of edges connecting to each face image. It significantly reduces the noise edges while maintaining the good ones to
build a graph with clean yet rich edges for GCNs to cluster faces. Experiments on
multiple public clustering datasets show that Ada-NETS significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, proving its superiority and generalization. Code

1 INTRODUCTION

The number of images on the web increases rapidly in recent years, a large portion of which are
human-centred photos. Understanding and managing these photos with little human involvement
are demanding, such as associating together photos from a certain person. A fundamental problem
towards these demands is face clustering (Driver & Kroeber, 1932).

Face clustering has been thoroughly investigated in recent years. Significant performance improvements (Wang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2019; 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021) have been
obtained with Graph Convolutional Networks due to their powerful feature propagation capacity.
The representative DA-Net (Guo et al., 2020) and STAR-FC (Shen et al., 2021) use GCNs to learn
enhanced feature embedding by vertices or edges classification tasks to assist clustering.

However, the main problem restricting the power of existing GCN-based face clustering algorithms
is the existence of noise edges in the face graphs. As shown in Figure 1 (b), a noise edge means the
connection between two faces of different classes. Unlike common graph datasets such as Citeseer,
Cora and Pubmed with explicit link relation as edges (Kipf & Welling, 2017), face images do not
contain explicit structural information, but only deep features extracted from a trained CNN model.
Therefore, face images are treated as vertices, and the edges between face images are usually constructed based on the kNN (Cover & Hart, 1967) relations when building the graph: Each face serves

as a probe to retrieve its k nearest neighbours by deep features (Wang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2019;
2020; Guo et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021). The kNN relations are not always reliable because deep
features are not accurate enough. So the noise edges are introduced to the graph along with the kNN.
The noise edges problem is common in face clustering but has received little research attention. For
example, the graph used in (Yang et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021) contains about 38.23% noise edges
in testing. The noise edges will propagate noisy information between vertices, hurting their features
when aggregation, and thus resulting in inferior performance. In Figure 1 (b), the triangular vertex
**v1 is connected with three vertices of different classes, and will it be polluted by them with mes-**
sages passing in the graph. Therefore, GCN-based linkage prediction cannot effectively address the
noise edges problem in related works (Wang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021).

The challenges of removing the noise edges in the face graphs are two-fold as shown in Figure 1 (c) (d). First, the representation ability of deep features is limited in real-world data. It is
difficult to tell whether two vertices are of the same class solely according to their deep features,
thus noise edges are inevitably brought by connecting two vertices of different classes. Second, it is
hard to determine how many edges to connect for each vertex when building a graph: Too few edges
connected will result in insufficient information aggregation in the graph. Too many edges connected will increase the number of noise edges, and the vertex feature will be polluted by wrongly
connected vertices. Although Clusformer (Nguyen et al., 2021) and GAT (Velickovic et al., 2018)
try to reduce the impact of the noise edges by the attention mechanism, the connections between
various vertices are very complex, and thus it is difficult to find common patterns for the attention
weight learning (Yang et al., 2020).

To overcome these tough challenges, the features around each vertex are taken into account because
they can provide more information. Specifically, each vertex feature representation can be improved
when considering other vertices nearby. This is beneficial to address the representation challenge
in Figure 1 (c). Then, the number of edges between one vertex and others can be learned from
feature patterns around it instead of a manually designed parameter for all vertices. This learning
method can effectively reduce the connection of noise edges which is crucial to address the second
challenge in Figure 1 (d). Based on the ideas above, a novel clustering algorithm, named Adaptive
**Neighbour discovEry in the strucTure Space (Ada-NETS), is proposed to handle the noise edges**
problem for clustering. In Ada-NETS, a structure space is first presented in which vertices can
obtain robust features by encoding more texture information after perceiving the data distribution.
Then, a candidate neighbours quality criterion is carefully designed to guide building less-noisy yet
rich edges, along with a learnable adaptive filter to learn this criterion. In this way, the neighbours
of each vertex are adaptively discovered to build the graph with clean and rich edges. Finally, GCNs
take this graph as input to cluster human faces.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

-  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the noise edges problem
when building a graph for GCNs on face images. Simultaneously, this paper demonstrates
its causes, great impact, weaknesses in existing solutions and the challenges to solve it.

2 RELATED WORK

**Face Clustering Face clustering tasks often face large-scale samples and complex data distribution,**
so it has attracted special research attention. Classic unsupervised methods are slow and cannot
achieve good performances for their naive distribution assumptions, such as convex-shaped data in
K-Means (Lloyd, 1982) and similar density of data in DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996)). In recent
years, GCN-based supervised methods are proved to be effective and efficient for face clustering.
L-GCN (Wang et al., 2019b) deploys a GCN for linkage prediction on subgraphs. DS-GCN (Yang
et al., 2019) and VE-GCN (Yang et al., 2020) both propose two-stage GCNs for clustering based on
the big kNN graph. DA-Net (Guo et al., 2020) conducts clustering by leveraging non-local context
information through density-based graph. Clusformer (Nguyen et al., 2021) clusters faces with a
transformer. STAR-FC (Shen et al., 2021) develops a structure-preserved sampling strategy to train
the edge classification GCN. These achievements show the power of GCNs in representation and
clustering. However, the existing methods mostly build face graphs based on kNN, which contain a
lot of noise edges. When building these graphs, the similarities between vertices are obtained only
according to deep features which are not always accurate, and the number of edges for each vertex
is fixed or determined by a similarity threshold.

**Graph Convolutional Networks** GCNs are proposed to deal with non-Euclidean data and have
shown their power in learning graph patterns. It is originally used for transductive semi-supervised
learning (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and is extended to inductive tasks by GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al.,
2017) that learns the feature aggregation principle. To further expand the representation power
of GCNs, learnable edge weights are introduced to the graph aggregation in the Graph Attention
Network (GAT) (Velickovic et al., 2018). In addition to face clustering, GCNs are also used in many
tasks such as skeleton-based action recognition (Yan et al., 2018), knowledge graph (Schlichtkrull
et al., 2018) and recommend system (Ying et al., 2018). However, these methods are proposed on
structure data, where the edges are explicitly given. The GCNs may not perform well on face image
datasets if the graph is constructed with a lot of noise edges.

3 METHODOLOGY

Face clustering aims to divide a set of face samples into groups so that samples in a group belong
to one identity, and any two samples in different groups belong to different identities. Given a set
of feature vectors V = {v1, v2, ..., vi, ..., vN | vi ∈ R[D]} extracted from face images by a trained

phase, adaptive filter learns to fit k[off]. In testing phase, adaptive filter estimates k[off] and removes the
off
candidate neighbours with orders beyond the predicted **k[ˆ]** .

CNN model, the clustering task assigns a group label for each vector vi. N is the total number of
samples, and D is the dimension of each feature. The Ada-NETS algorithm is proposed as shown
in Figure 2 to cluster faces by dealing with the noise edges in face graphs. Firstly, the features
are transformed to the proposed structure space for an accurate similarity metric. Then an adaptive
neighbour discovery strategy is used to find neighbours for each vertex. Based on the discovery
results, a graph with clean and rich edges is built as the input graph of GCNs for the final clustering.

3.1 STRUCTURE SPACE

The noise edges problem will lead to the pollution of vertices features, degrading the performance
of GCN-based clustering. It is difficult to determine whether two vertices belong to the same class
just based on their deep features, because two vertices of different classes can also have a high
similarity, thus introducing noise edges. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, almost all
existing methods (Wang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021) build
graphs only based on the pairwise cosine similarity between vertices using deep features. In fact, the
similarity metric can be improved by considering the structure information, that is the neighbourhood relationships between images of the dataset. Based on this idea, the concept of the structure
space is proposed to tackle this challenge. In the structure space, the features can encode more texture information by perceiving the data distribution thus being more robust (Zhang et al., 2020). A
transforming function φ is deployed to convert one feature vi into the structure space, noted as vi[s][:]

**vi[s]** [=][ φ][ (][v][i][|V][)][,][ ∀][i][ ∈{][1][,][ 2][,][ · · ·][, N] _[}][.]_ (1)

As shown in Figure 2 (I), with the help of the structure space, for one vertex vi, its similarities with
other vertices are computed by the following steps: First, kNN of vi are obtained via an Approximate Nearest-neighbour (ANN) algorithm based on the cosine similarity between vi and the other
vertices, noted as (vi, k) = **vi1** _, vi2_ _,_ _, vik_ . Second, motivate by the kernel method (Shawe_N_ _{_ _· · ·_ _}_
Taylor & Cristianini, 2004), instead of directly solving the form of φ, we define the similarity of vi
to each of its candidates in the structure space by

_κ_ **vi, vij** = **vi[s][,][ v]i[s]j**

(2)

where η weights the cosine similarity   ≜ D(1 − _η)sE[Jac][  ]vi s, v[cos]ij[  ]v+i ηs, vi[cos]j_ [  ]v=i, v∥ivjvi∥i,·∥vvijij∀j∥ ∈{[and the Jaccard similarity]1, 2, · · ·, k},

_s[Jac][  ]vi, vij_ that is inspired by the common-neighbour-based metric (Zhong et al., 2017). With
the definitions above, κ **vi, vij** measures the similarity between vi and vij in the structure space.

3.2 ADAPTIVE NEIGHBOUR DISCOVERY

The existing methods link edges from naive kNN relations retrieved by deep features (Wang et al.,
2019b; Yang et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021) or using a fixed similarity threshold (Guo et al., 2020).
These methods are all one-size-fits-all solutions and the hyper-parameters have a great impact on the
performance. To address this issue, the adaptive neighbour discovery module is proposed to learn
from the features pattern around each vertex as shown in Figure 2 (II).


-----

For the vertex vi, its candidate neighbours of size j are the j nearest neighbour vertices based on
the similarity of their deep features, where j = 1, 2, · · ·, k. Its neighbours mean one specific sized
candidate neighbours that satisfy some particular criterion described as follows. The edges between
_vi and all its neighbours are constructed._

3.2.1 CANDIDATE NEIGHBOURS QUALITY CRITERION

Motivated by the vertex confidence estimation method (Yang et al., 2020), a heuristic criterion is
designed to assess the quality of candidate neighbours for each probe vertex. Good neighbours
should be clean, i.e., most neighbours should have the same class label with the probe vertex, so that
noise edges will not be included in large numbers when building a graph. The neighbours should
also be rich, so that the message can fully pass in the graph. To satisfy the two principles, the
criterion is proposed according to the Fβ-score (Rijsbergen, 1979) in information retrieval. Similar
to visual grammars (Nguyen et al., 2021), all candidate neighbours are ordered by the similarity with
the probe vertex in a sequence. Given candidate neighbours of size j probed by vertex vi, its quality
criterion Q (j) is defined as:

_Pr[j]Rc[j]_
_Q (j) = Fβ[j]_ [= (1 +][ β][2][)] (3)

_β[2]Pr[j]_ + Rc[j][,]

where Pr[j] and Rc[j] are the precision and recall of the first j candidate neighbours with respect to
the label of vi. β is a weight balancing precision and recall. A higher Q-value indicates a better
candidate neighbours quality.

3.2.2 ADAPTIVE FILTER

With the criterion above, k[off] is defined as the heuristic ground truth value of the number of neighbours to choose:
**k[off]** = arg max (4)
_j_ 1,2,...k _[Q][ (][j][)][ .]_
_∈{_ _}_

As shown in Figure 3, the adaptive filter estimates k[off] by finding the position of the highest Q-value on the Q-value curve. The input of the adaptive filter is the feature vectors

[vi, vi1 _, vi2_ _, · · ·,, vik_ ][T] _∈_ R[(][k][+1)][×][D]. In training, given a mini-batch with B sequences, adaptive filter is trained using the Huber loss (Huber, 1992):

& Paliwal, 1997; Graves & Schmidhuber, 2005) and two Fully-Connected layers with shortcuts.


3.3 ADA-NETS FOR FACE CLUSTERING

To effectively address the noise edges problem in face clustering, Ada-NETS first takes advantage of
the proposed structure space and adaptive neighbour discovery to build a graph with clean and rich
edges. Then a GCN model is used to complete the clustering in this graph as shown in Figure 2 (III).
With similarity metric in the structure space and adaptive neighbour discovery method above, the
discovered neighbours of vertex vi is denoted as N _[s](vi, k):_

_[s](vi, k) =_ **vij** **vij** (vi, k), Indj **k** _,_ (6)

neighbour relations, an undirected graph (F, A) is generated by linking an edge between two

vertices if any of which is the discovered neighbour of the other. F = [v1, v2, _, vN_ ][T] is the
_· · ·_
vertex feature matrix, and A is the adjacency matrix:

**Aij =** 01,, otherwisevi ∈N _[s](.vj, k) or vj ∈N_ _[s](vi, k),_ (7)


With the built graph G (F, A), A GCN model is used to learn whether two vertices belong to the
same class. One GCN layer is defined as:

**Fl+1 = σ(D[˜]** _[−][1][ ˜]AFlWl),_ (8)

whereNj=1 **AA[˜][˜]i,j =, F Al and + I W, I ∈l are respectively the input feature matrix and weight matrix ofR[N]** _[×][N]_ is an identity matrix, **D[˜]** is the diagonal degree matrix that l-th layer, andD[˜] _ii =_
_σ(_ ) is an activation function. Two GCN layers are used in this paper, followed with one FC layer
P·
with PReLU (He et al., 2015) activation and one normalization. For a batch of randomly sampled
vertices Bv, the training loss is defined as a variant version of Hinge loss (Rosasco et al., 2004):


_L[Hinge]_ = L[neg] + λL[pos],

(9)

[β1−yvi,vj ]+, _L[neg]_ = maxli=lj [[][β][2][ +][ y][v][i][,][v][j] []][+][,]
_li=lj_ _̸_

X


where L[pos] =


_∥li = lj∥_


where yvi,vj is the cosine similarity of the GCN output features v[′]i and v[′]j of the two vertices
**vi and vj in the batch Bv, [·]+ = max(0, ·), ∥li = lj∥** is the number of the positive pairs, i.e.,
the ground-truth label li of vi and the ground-truth label lj of vj are the same; β1 and β2 are the
margins of the positive and negative losses, and λ is the weight balancing the two losses.

During inference, the whole graph of test data is input into GCN to obtain enhanced features F[′] =

[v[′]1, v[′]2, · · ·, v[′]N ][T] _∈_ R[N] _[×][D][′]_ for all vertices, where D[′] is the dimension of each new feature.
Pairs of vertices are linked when their similarity scores are larger than a predefined threshold θ.
Finally, clustering is done by merging all links transitively with the union-find algorithm, i.e., waitfree parallel algorithms(Anderson & Woll, 1991).

4 EXPERIMENTS

4.1 EVALUATION METRICS, DATASETS, AND EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

The Signal-Noise Rate (SNR) and Q-value are used to directly evaluate the quality of graph building,
where SNR is the ratio of the number of correct edges and noise edges in the graph. BCubed F**score FB (Bagga & Baldwin, 1998; Amig´o et al., 2009) and Pairwise F-score FP (Shi et al., 2018)**
are used to evaluate the final clustering performance.

Three datasets are used in the experiments: MS-Celeb-1M (Guo et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2019) is
a large-scale face dataset with about 5.8M face images of 86K identities after data cleaning. For a
fair comparison, we follow the same protocol and features as VE-GCN (Yang et al., 2019) to divide
the dataset evenly into ten parts by identities, and use part 0 as the training set and part 1 to part 9
as the testing set. In addition to the face data, Ada-NETS has also been evaluated for its potential in
clustering other objects. The clothes dataset DeepFashion (Liu et al., 2016) is used with the same
subset, split settings and features as VE-GCN (Yang et al., 2020), where there are 25,752 images
of 3,997 categories for training, and 26,960 images of 3,984 categories for testing. MSMT17 (Wei
et al., 2018) is the current largest ReID dataset widely used (Chen et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2021).
Its images are captured under different weather, light conditions and time periods from 15 cameras,
which are challenging for clustering. There are 32,621 images of 1,041 individuals for training and
93,820 images of 3,060 individuals for testing. Features are obtained from a model trained on the
training set (He et al., 2020).

The learning rate is initially 0.01 for training the adaptive filter and 0.1 for training the GCN with
cosine annealing. δ = 1 for Huber loss, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 1.0, λ = 1 for Hingle loss and β = 0.5
for Q-value. The SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9 and weight decay 1e-5 is used. k is set
80, 5, 40 on MS-Celeb-1M, DeepFashion, and MSMT17. The experiments are conducted with
PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and DGL (Wang et al., 2019a).

Face clustering performance is evaluated on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset with different numbers of
unlabeled images. Comparison approaches include classic clustering methods K-Means (Lloyd,
1982), HAC (Sibson, 1973), DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996), and graph-based methods L-GCN (Wang
et al., 2019b), DS-GCN (Yang et al., 2019), VE-GCN (Yang et al., 2020), DA-Net (Guo et al.,
2020), Clusformer (Nguyen et al., 2021) and STAR-FC (Shen et al., 2021). In this section, to
further enhance the clustering performance of GCNs, some noise is added to the training graph.
Results in Table 1 show that the proposed Ada-NETS reaches the best performance in all tests (θ =
0.96), outperforming STAR-FC by 1.19% to reach 91.40% BCubed F-score on 584K unlabeled
data. With the increase in the number of unlabeled images, the proposed Ada-NETS keeps superior
performance, revealing the significance of graph building in large-scale clustering.

To further evaluate the generalization ability of our approach in non-face clustering tasks, comparisons are also conducted on DeepFashion and MSMT17. As shown in Table 2, Ada-NETS achieves
the best performance in the clothes and person clustering tasks.

tions of the structure space and adaptive neighbour discovery. The SNR of the built graph and the
BCubed and Pairwise F-scores are compared. It is observed that the structure space and adaptive
neighbour discovery both contribute to the performance improvement, between which the adaptive
neighbour discovery contributes more. With both components, the graph’s SNR is largely enhanced

by 13.38 times, and the clustering performance is also largely improved. Each line in Figure 4
shows the discovery results with the first image as the probe, ranked by the similarity in the structure space. The images with a blue circle are of the same identity as the probe. They all successfully
obtain greater similarity in the structure space than those with a red triangle that represents different
identities. With the help of the adaptive filter, images after the yellow vertical line are filtered out,
remaining clean and rich neighbours. Without the adaptive filter, the images with a red triangle will
be connected with its probe, leading to pollution of the probe.

**Study on the quality criterion According to Equation 3, the criterion contains a hyper-parameter**
_β. Smaller β emphasizes more on precision, and bigger β emphasizes more on recall. We choose_
three mostly-used values β ∈{0.5, 1.0, 2.0} to study how it affects the neighbour discovery and
clustering. Table 4 shows the performance of Ada-NETS under different β in the original (denoted as
Ori.) and structure space (denoted as Str.). Q[before] and Q[after] are the Q-value of candidate neighbours
of size k and k[off]. FP and FB are the corresponding clustering performance under k[off]. It is observed
that Q[after] is obviously improved compared with Q[before] in all circumstance. For the same β, the
improvements are more obvious in the structure space than in the original space. As analysed above,
a higher Q-value indicates a better candidate neighbours quality, e.g., more noise edges will be
eliminated (clean) or more correct edges will be kept (rich) in the graph. Therefore, the clustering
performance in the structure space is also higher than in the original space as is expected. In addition,
_β = 0.5 achieves the best clustering performance in both spaces while much less sensitive in the_
structure space to reach 95.51% Pairwise F-score and 94.93% BCubed F-score.

**Study on the adaptive filter Adaptive filter is proposed to select neighbours from candidate neigh-**
bours. Compared with the estimation method to regress k[off] directly in the adaptive filter, noted as

to learn. GAT is also compared to eliminate noise edges by the attention mechanism, but does not
obtain competitive results because of the complex feature pattern (Yang et al., 2020).

**Study on the sensitivity to k** Figure 5 (a) shows the clustering performance with the variance of
_k. “kNN” represents directly selecting the nearest k neighbours to build the graph as in existing_
methods (Yang et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021), and “Structure kNN” represents selecting kNN in
the structure space with N (v, 256). Despite the help in the structure space, the two kNN methods
are all sensitive to k since more noise edges are included when k increases. The “Threshold” and
“Chain Sim” method are also also sensitive to the number of candidate neighbours and have not
achieved good results. The details of each method can be found in Table 9 in appendix. However,
the proposed Ada-NETS can relatively steadily obtain good performance, showing that our method
can effectively provide clean and rich neighbours to build the graph for GCNs.

**Study on the graph embedding** In Ada-NETS, GCN is used to produce more compactly distributed features, thus more suitable for clustering. ROC curves of one billion randomly selected
pairs are shown in Figure 5 (b). It is observed that the original feature embedding (OFE) obtains
the worst ROC performance, and the graph embedding (GE) output by the GCN is enhanced by a
large margin. With the help of the adaptive neighbour discovery (GE + AND), the output feature is
more discriminating. When the discovery is applied in the structure space (GE + AND + SS), GCN
can output the most discriminating features. Distributions of embeddings after dimensionality reduction via PCA (Pearson, 1901) of ten randomly selected identities are shown in Figure 5 (c). It is
observed that the better ROC performance a kind of feature embedding has in Figure 5 (b), the more
compact its embeddings are for a certain identity. With better features embeddings, the clustering
can be started again. In Table 10 of appendix, the clustering results on MS-Celeb-1M are compared
with the ones using original feature embeddings. It is observed that the graph embeddings further
enhance Ada-NETS. The details are described in Section A.8 of appendix.


5 CONCLUSION

This paper presents a novel Ada-NETS algorithm to deal with the noise edges problem when building the graph in GCN-based face clustering. In Ada-NETS, the features are first transformed to the
structure space to enhance the accuracy of the similarity metrics. Then an adaptive neighbour discovery method is used to find neighbours for all samples adaptively with the guidance of a heuristic
quality criterion. Based on the discovered neighbour relations, a graph with clean and rich edges is
built as the input of GCNs to obtain state-of-the-art on the face, clothes, and person clustering tasks.

A APPENDIX

In this appendix, we present the supplementary information on 1) the calculations of the precision
and recall; 2) the calculation of the Jaccard similarity; 3) the detailed description of different designs
of the adaptive filter; 4) the baseline results of selecting neighbours by various thresholds based on
the cosine similarity of deep features; 5) the baseline results of directly clustering on the built graph
without GCNs; 6) the time-consuming analysis of Ada-NETS.

A.1 PRECISION AND RECALL

In the paper, precision Pr[j] and recall Rc[j] are used to obtain the quality criterion Q in Equation 3.
The calculations of Pr[j] and Rc[j] are illustrated by example in Figure 6. Given a dataset that has
15 samples of three classes, assume that one probe sample belonging to class 1 is selected from the
dataset. Samples are first ranked by their similarities to the probe. For candidate neighbours of size
_j (j = 6), Pr[j]_ and Rc[j] are 6[4] [and][ 4]8 [respectively, as calculated in the Figure 6.]

A.2 THE JACCARD SIMILARITY

In the paper, feature similarities are calculated in the structure space as in Equation 2. This similarity includes the Jaccard similarity which is calculated based on the k-reciprocal nearest neighbours (Zhong et al., 2017), defined as

_s[Jac][  ]vi, vij_ = _[|R][∗]([(]v[v][i]i, k[, k])[)][ ∩R][∗]([(]v[v][i]i[j]j_ _, k[, k])[)][|]_ (10)

_|R[∗]_ _∪R[∗]_ _|_ _[,]_



where R[∗](v, k) encodes the structure information of feature v with a variant version of k-reciprocal
nearest neighbours:


(v, k) (v, k) (r, [1]
_R[∗]_ _←R_ _∪R_ 2 _[k][)][,]_

(11)

s.t. (v, k) (r, [1]
_|R_ _∩R_ 2 _[k][)][| ≥]_ [2]3 _[|R][(][r][,][ 1]2_ _[k][)][|][,][ ∀][r][ ∈R][(][v][, k][)][,]_

where
_R(v, k) = {r | v ∈N_ (r, k), ∀r ∈N (v, k)}. (12)

With the definition above, data distribution can be perceived in the structure space to obtain more
accurate feature similarities.

A.3 DESIGNS OF ADAPTIVE FILTER

In the paper, four kinds of different designs for the adaptive filter are proposed and their performances are compared in Table 5. Two methods estimate Q values, and two estimate k[off] directly.
Table 6 shows detailed descriptions of the four designs.

Table 6: Descriptions of four kinds of different designs of the adaptive filter.

Symbol Method Description

**E[Q]seq** Regress Q-values in Equation 3 in the paper for each j 1, 2, _, k_ .
_∈{_ _· · ·_ _}_
During inference, **k[ˆ][off]** is determined by Equation 4 using predicted Qvalues.
**E[Q]param** Use a quadratic curve to fit the trends of Q(j) with respect to j, which is
then used to predict Q values to get **k[ˆ][off]** as defined in Equation 4 during
inference. The parameters of the quadratic curve is learned as targets in
this method.
**E[k]cls** Formulate the k[off] estimation as a multi-class classification task. One class
for each possible j value in Equation 4 and use softmax loss in training.
**E[k]reg** Regress directly the ground-truth k[off] values as defined in Equation 4.

A.4 CLUSTERING WITH FIXED THRESHOLDS

In addition to directly selecting the nearest k neighbours to build the graph as in Figure 5 (a), selecting nearest neighbours by a fixed similarity threshold is also evaluated. In Table 7, it is observed that
the best performance is achieved when the similarity threshold is 0.60. The highest Pairwise and
BCubed F-score are 87.59 and 87.13, which are much lower than 92.79 and 91.40 of Ada-NETS.
This shows that the method of selecting neighbours by a fixed threshold for all samples is not as
good as the proposed method in Ada-NETS, which is adaptive for each sample.

Table 7: Bcubed F-score of using various thresholds to select neighbours to build graph.

Threshold 0.75 0.70 0.65 0.60 0.55

_FP_ 68.48 79.64 86.58 **87.59** 77.88
_FB_ 67.74 78.26 85.04 **87.13** 79.43

A.5 CLUSTERING WITHOUT GCNS

When a graph with clean and rich edges is built after neighbour discovery, a naive graph-cut can be
conducted on the graph as the clustering baseline. The graph-cut method directly breaks the edges
that have similarities lower than a predefined similarity threshold (which is tuned for the best), and
no GCNs are used.

Table 8: Comparison of clustering performance of graph-cut (in the original space and structure
space) and Ada-NETS on MS-Celeb-1M part 1.

Method _FP_ _FB_

Graph-cut (Original) 72.95 76.22
Graph-cut (Structure) 82.36 85.09
Ada-NETS **92.79** **91.40**

In Table 8, the first two lines show the clustering performance of graph-cut in the original space and
structure space. Compared with Ada-NETS, the first two methods have very poor performances.
This shows that the GCN module is important for clustering. In addition, it can be seen that the clustering performance using graph-cut in the structure space is better than in the original space, proving


-----

that vertices can obtain robust features by encoding more texture information after perceiving the
data distribution in the structure space.

A.6 CLUSTERING TIME-CONSUMING ANALYSIS

Empirically, Ada-NETS takes about 18.9 minutes to cluster part 1 test set (about 584k samples)
on 54 E5-2682 v4 CPUs and 8 NVIDIA P100 cards. It is much faster than L-GCN (Wang et al.,
2019b) and LTC (Yang et al., 2019) which take 86.8 minutes and 62.2 minutes, but slower than
STAR-FC (Shen et al., 2021), DA-NET (Guo et al., 2020) and VE-GCN (Yang et al., 2020) which
take about 5 to 11 minutes. Many parts of Ada-NETS can be easily parallelized, but it is out of the
scope of this work. Although Ada-NETS is not the fastest, the time consumption is still within a
reasonable range.

A.7 COMPARISON WITH OTHER GRAPH BUILDING METHODS

In Figure 5 (a), the Bcubed F-score of Ada-NETS is compared with four other graph building
methods under different k value to show its superiority and robustness. Methods for comparison
include: kNN, Structure kNN, Threshold, and Chain Sim. Table 9 shows detailed description of
these graph building methods.

A.8 ADA-NETS WITH BETTER FEATURES EMBEDDINGS

These discriminating graph embeddings of “GE + AND + SS” are used as the input of Ada-NETS
to get the final clustering results for enhancement (θ = 0.99). In Table 10, the clustering results on
MS-Celeb-1M are compared with the ones using original feature embeddings. It is observed that the

graph embeddings further enhance Ada-NETS from state-of-the-art to a remarkable 93.74% on FP,
achieving nearly 1% improvement on 584K unlabeled data again.
