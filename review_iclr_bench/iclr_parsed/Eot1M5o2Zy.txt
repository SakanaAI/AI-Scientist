Paper under double-blind review

ABSTRACT

Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) aims to develop a machine that can automatically
evaluate facial attractiveness. Usually, these results were highly correlated with
human ratings, and therefore also reflected human bias in annotations. Everyone
will have biases that are usually subconscious and not easy to notice. Unconscious
bias deserves more attention than explicit discrimination. It affects moral judgement
and can evade moral responsibility, and we cannot eliminate it completely. A new
challenge for scientists is to provide training data and AI algorithms that can
withstand distorted information. Our experiments prove that human aesthetic
judgements are usually biased. In this work, we introduce AestheticNet, the most
advanced attractiveness prediction network, with a Pearson correlation coefficient
of 0.9601, which is significantly better than the competition. This network is then
used to enrich the training data with synthetic images in order to overwrite the
ground truth values with fair assessments.
We propose a new method to generate an unbiased CNN to improve the fairness
of machine learning. Prediction and recommender systems based on Artificial
Intelligence (AI) technology are widely used in various sectors of industry, such
as intelligent recruitment, security, etc. Therefore, their fairness is very important.
Our research provides a practical example of how to build a fair and trustable AI.

1 MOTIVATION

In 2016 Beauty.AI, a Hong-Kong based technology company, hosted the first international beauty
contest judged by artificial intelligence (beauty.ai, 2016) but the results were heavily biased, for
example, against dark skin (Levin, 2016) subjects. “Machine learning models are prone to biased
decisions, due to biases in data-sets” (Sharma et al., 2020). Biased training data potentially leads
to discriminatory models, as the datasets are created by humans or derived from human activities
in the past, for example hiring algorithms (Bogen, 2019). The reason for racist and discriminatory
tendencies must be identified. As the learning algorithms become more complex, understanding why
the decisions are made, or even how, prove to be nearly impossible (Bostrom & Yudkowsky, 2018).
Therefore, the development of non-biased and fair training data and AI algorithms (defined by the
European Commission High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (European Commission
High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence [AI HLEG], 2019)) is a new and increasingly
complex challenge for scientists around the world (Bellamy et al., 2018). The specific field of
aesthetic judgement is especially vulnerable to being biased, as aesthetic judgement itself is already a
subjective rating (Richmond, 2017).

The purpose of facial beauty prediction (FBP) research is to classify images mimicking subjective
human judgements. Investigations related to machine perception in a ground-truth free setting
show that the data source depends on the measurement of human perception (Prijatelj et al., 2020).
Therefore, artificial networks need a process to determine labels of the average person’s judgement.
Our data analysis has already proven that people consider their own ethnicity to be more attractive
than others (Gerlach et al., 2020), this is the major bias in our experiments and within our dataset.
With this tendency, it becomes difficult to generate input data to train a machine-learning algorithm,
which assesses a person’s attractiveness without bias.

This work not only helps to achieve moral enhancement through AI (see appendix B.1), but also
helps eliminating social problems with this new technology (see appendix B.2).

2 STATE OF THE ART

While research on the estimation of images or portraits is not a new trend, it has gained increasing
attention since the emergence of artificial intelligence (Zhang & Kreiman, 2021). Although, for many
applications like autonomous driving, or image classification, AI undoubtedly is the best solution,
applications that are affected by unconscious bias, like beauty prediction (Dornaika et al., 2020), tend
to reflect bias that is likely to be prevalent within given datasets. Especially, when people subjective
preferences play a role, such as in attractiveness judgement (Shank & DeSanti, 2018) or human
resource evaluation (Lloyd, 2018), bias is almost certain to happen. Carrera (2020) conducted a
piece of research on the implication of racism in image databases, that analysed the association of
aggressiveness, kindness, beauty and ugliness with different images and found that the decisions of
many people are affected by subconscious racism. Since researchers are aware of such effect, they
found different ways to reduce subconscious bias in machine learning. Since the problem originates
from the given databases, either the databases, or the training need to be changed.

The possibilities to change the databases include adding data, also referred to as fair pre_processing (Bellamy et al., 2018), either by selection or augmentation to insert underrepresented_
samples. While, deleting images is usually a bad idea, since it increases the chances of the network
overfitting, it could theoretically be used to eliminate overrepresented images. On the other side, training can be altered by selecting only images, that do not increase the variance of each class currently
used as training input. For example, variational autoencoders can be used to extract the features of
the image, to later determine their variance, and only select images as input that do not increase the
variance within given classes. Bellamy et al. (2018) also describe a third method, they called fair
_post-processing. Since their pipeline aimed to create debiased databases, the post-processing step is_
usually not applicable for most machine learning applications not creating databases.

3 BIASED AI

3.1 BIAS FROM HUMAN INDICATIONS


Figure 1: Chinese and European annotations, the
red bar represents the score of Asian, the blue bar
represents the score of European faces.


Figure 2: AestheticNet is trained on German
or Chinese annotations only. The trained network follows the bias from the annotations.


First, we propose hypothesis 1: The results of the evaluation of the attractiveness of female pictures
in the Asia-Europe data set by annotators in China and Germany are implicitly biased. We use our
latest data set, which includes a total of 12,034 images of people from different social and ethnical
backgrounds, with a total of 5.4 million annotations. Chinese and German participants have rated the
pictures in the data set. We then have a comparison result to prove whether hypothesis 1 is true and
mark this evaluation result as a ground truth. Figure 1 and fig. 2 confirm the statement of the first
hypothesis. Further more, in this process, the results of our research also shows that aesthetic bias is
not only related to ethnic background, but also related to age which also has been proven by other
researchers (Gerlach et al., 2020), (Akbari et al., 2020).

3.2 AI TAKES ON HUMAN BIAS

We propose hypothesis 2: artificial intelligence will copy the human bias. We use convolutional
neural networks (CNN) to predict facial aesthetic scores and introduce AestheticNet.

**Related Work.** With the introduction of CNNs and large-scale image repositories, facial image
and video tasks get more powerful (Krizhevsky et al., 2017; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013; Deng et al.,


-----

2009). Xie et al. (Xie et al., 2015a) present the SCUT-FBP500 dataset, containing 500 Asian
female subjects with attractiveness ratings. Since “FBP is a multi-paradigm computation problem”
the successor SCUT-FBP5500 (Liang et al., 2018) is introduced in 2018, including an increased
database of 5500 frontal faces with multiple attributes: male/female, Asian/Caucasian, age, beauty
score. Liang et al. (2018) have evaluated their database “using different combinations of feature and
predictor, and various deep learning methods” on AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2017), ResNet-18 (He
et al., 2015) and ResNeXt-50 and achieved the Pearson Correlation PC: 0.8777; mean average error
_MAE: 0.2518; root-mean-square error RMSE: 0.3325 as a benchmark. In summary it can be said that_
all deep CNN models are superior to the shallow predictor with hand-crafted geometric feature or
appearance feature (Liang et al., 2018).

**Benchmark Dataset.** The SCUT-FBP 5500 data set is a small data set for deep learning tasks.
Therefore, it is an even greater challenge to train soft features like aesthetic or beauty. In order to
measure the accuracy of the network and to be comparable to recent experiments in facial beauty
prediction, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (PC), mean absolute error (MAE) and
root mean square error (RMSE).

Figure 3: The architecture of AestheticNet is based on the VGG Face architecture and is expanded
by two separate skip connections. At the end, the predictions of the differently convoluted feature
vectors are added together.

**AestheticNet predictor architecture.** The VGG Face architecture (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015)
is the basis of our AestheticNet. Inspired by an idea of the paper from Shelhamer et al. (2017) we then
add modifications to the network by exploiting feature maps from the third and fourth convolution
block. Since the size of the features maps differ from the size of the resulting feature vector, we
implement an additional max pooling layer to achieve the wanted output. For the predictions of the
network, we concatenate the softmax results into a single feature vector as shown in fig. 3.

Our proposed network achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9601, which indicates an almost
linear correspondence between annotations and predictions. Our training results have a very high
accuracy and outperform state-of-the-art results. The normalised mean square error is 3.896% and
the normalised root mean square error is 5.580%. These are measurements of the average error of the
predicted labels, which are used to evaluate the accuracy of the network. The results are normalised
because there are different datasets with different score ranges.

**Reannotation of SCUT-FBP5500 dataset.** Since 2013, for our study of facial aesthetics, we
conducted online surveys on multiple image datasets (mentioned in table 2) where thousands of
students and their relatives participated. With this process we have been able to gather enough data
to train a convolutional neural network with the goal to improve facial beauty prediction. During

training convolutional neural networks (CNN) on this data, we recognised a large bias in this data.
This led us to evaluate the annotations from Chinese and German universities and take a closer look
at the bias. Our null hypothesis was that there is no bias in dependency of the ethical group, the proof
for the presence of bias was done by reductio ad absurdum.

In null hypothesis significance testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at
least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is
correct (Aschwanden, 2015). The precise calculation of the p-value in this experiment is difficult
because the factorials raise too high, to be reasonably computed on the thousands of labelled values.
We calculate the p-value on 300 representative annotations which lead to a p-value of approximately
0.063%, therefore it is safe to say the null hypothesis can be rejected and we do have an ethical bias.

4 TRAINING OF UNBIASED AI

In general, there are three main paths to reach the goal of unbiased predictions: fair pre-processing,
fair in-processing and fair post-processing (Bellamy et al., 2018). Within this paper, we present two
approaches based on those paths to train an unbiased network with biased data, for FBP. The first
approach relies on data pre-processing before training to introduce fairness, we call it “balanced
training”. The second approach relies on a categorical cross entropy loss function, for the network to
learn the bias and decrease it. Those processes are explained in the following sections.

4.1 DATASET AND GAN IMAGES

Machine learning has evolved in the past decades and stands out due to the fact that the knowledge in
the system is not provided by experts. Facial beauty prediction (FBP) that is consistent with human
perception, is a significant visual recognition problem and a much-studied subject in recent decades.
Eisenthal et al. (2006) and (Kagian et al., 2008) were among the first to publish their research about
automatic facial attractiveness predictors and supervised learning techniques, based on the extraction
of feature landmarks on faces. We analysed the data that we gathered with our Analysis Toolbox
and could measure a significant bias within the prediction of aesthetics through different ethnicities.
Therefore, training a network with the goal to create unbiased results is still a challenge in deep
learning tasks. In the following we will first describe our data set blend and the accompanying
Analysis Toolbox and we explain how we used a GAN to create artificial portraits with European and
Asian ethnicities.

Starting in 2017, we used the Asian-European-dataset SCUT-FBP (Xie et al., 2015b; Liang et al.,
2018) to evaluate biased annotations from Chinese and German universities. The results proved the
assumption that German students favour images of European women and vice versa Chinese students
rate Asian portraits higher. Since the SCUT-FBP 5500 dataset is a small dataset for deep learning
tasks, we use data augmentation methods to enlarge the sample size of the training set by generating
GAN images with either Asian or European or mixed images as input and new synthesised images
as output. This augmentation method proves superior to geometric transformations like cropping


-----

and rotating. All images are preprocessed, by normalisation methods to harmonise face pose, facial
landmark positions and image size.

For the purpose of a thorough analysis, we blend multiple datasets in the domain of facial aesthetics
together. Our complete set of databases which is described in table 2, consists of multiracial and
multiethnic individuals. In total, this data set includes 12,034 portrait images from persons of different
ethnicities with individual social backgrounds. These images are labelled and annotated in surveys
over a period of 8 years with a total number of 5.4 million annotations. Additionally, recently we add
the FairFace (Karkk¨ ainen & Joo, 2019) database, which includes male and female portraits of seven¨
different ethnic groups.

Figure 4: StarGAN v2 generated Eurasians. From left to right: 90%, 80%, 70%, 60% European,
half/half, 60%, 70%, 80% 90% Asian

The synthesised Eurasians images are artificially generated with StarGAN v2 (Choi et al., 2020)
to determine the influence of the biased view of annotators on aesthetics of persons from different
ethnicities. We used different customised input for the source and reference images to control the
amount of ethnic admixture. Figure 4 shows one exemplary set of images for the Eurasians dataset.


Figure 5: Unconscious bias towards ethnic aesthetic of either German or Chinese annotators. Left:
average aesthetic score on SCUT-FBP by German annotators, middle: average aesthetic score labelled
by Chinese students, right: aesthetic scores on the Eurasian dataset annotated by German students.

After annotating the dataset, the unconscious bias in the annotations can be uncovered. Figure 5
shows the biased average score of our networks on the SCUT-FBP dataset and the Eurasian dataset.

Figure 6 illustrates the analysis on the distribution of aesthetic score and age for Asians, Europeans
and three mixed-racial subgroups. The different group annotation points are displayed in different
colours. We calculate the following metrics for each group cluster i: Horizontal dashed lines are
average attractiveness values ai. Vertical dashed lines are average age values yi. As can be seen, the
interval of ai has a small span, yet however the interval of yi has a significantly larger span. Each ai
and yi values intersection point forms an per group attractiveness-age-factor AAFi = ai/yi. In a fair
machine, these AAFi points would be closer together, as the yi span is small. This idea is further
elaborated in section 4.

Figure 6: Biased correlation between attractiveness, age and ethnicity by German annotators. In
an ethical, fair network the attractiveness for equal age groups would be the same. This would be
represented in the figure by the same height of the lines for equal age groups.

4.2 TRAINING AND DATA PRE-PROCESSING

In our first approach of training the network we have applied pre-processing and resampling to the
input data, which is explained in the following paragraphs.

This paper proposes a way to create a fair network with this biased data. Therefore, the bias must
be identified in the ground truth labels of the dataset and divided into two subsets. The first subset
(German annotations) confirms and increases the existing bias whereas the second subset (Chinese
annotations) consists of the contrary prejudices. Afterwards, a GAN then generates synthetic images,
which are a gradation of the mixture of the first and second subset. The least biased result according
to our understanding is the best balance of the generated images. This knowledge can then be applied
back to the original data set. This implies the height difference of all the bars should be minimised.

In our training process, we have a clear bias in the annotations, as shown in fig. 2 and measured
in the analysis of the data. If we train our network based only on this labels, it follows the data
and replicates the bias from the annotations, as shown in the comparison of the predictions with the
annotations in fig. 2. Chinese annotators rate Asian faces higher, based on this data our prediction is
biased towards higher aesthetic scores of Asian Faces. This is the same if we train the machine only
on European Faces, annotated by Germans. In the next training, we added the annotations from the
Chinese and German annotators and trained the network on an equal distribution of those annotations
(Ratio: 1.0). The result is shown in fig. 7 on the left side of the diagram. The average aesthetic rating
of European and Asian faces is still biased, however not as strong as in the previous experiment. The
eleven bars on the right side of fig. 7 show the average aesthetic score based on the ethnicity. The
bias is shown in more detail, ranging from 100% to 70% European who have the highest aesthetic
score, to the lowest aesthetic score, the more Asian looking the portrait is. As a result, the network is
still biased, a network trained on this data reflects the bias in the FBP.

Figure 7: FBP with same amount of Asian and
German labels. Ratio = 1.0 stands for the same
weight ω for German and Asian annotations.


Figure 8: Correlation of the bias over the ratio of
German and Chinese annotations. The least bias
here is at the ratio of 1.9


In this experiment, balancing the training data means to find the minimum by concatenating the
German annotated subset g with the weighted ω Chinese annotated subset c. The goal in this approach
is to level the average aesthetic scores g and c for the generated predictions gi and ci. The network
bias B is then defined by


_g_ _gi_ + ω _c_ _ci_ _._ (1)
_|_ _−_ _|_ _|_ _−_ _|_
_i=0_

X


_B =_


2n + 1


Starting from a ratio of 1:1, in which German and Chinese annotations are distributed equally, we
gradually increase the weight of the Chinese annotations. Technically, the balancing of distribution of
the training data is done with a factor based approach. First, the ratio between Chinese and European
annotations are calculated. Secondly, the factor for the balanced distribution is determined in a
stochastic approach. In our experiment we varied the ratio from 2:1 to 1:3.2 for German annotations
to Chinese annotations. Each training step and the corresponding bias over the ratio is shown in
fig. 8. Determining the minimum in fig. 8 is equal to finding the least biased network. It is visible
that a ratio of 1:1.9 produces the least biased network for this experiment and its results are shown in
fig. 9. This means the Chinese annotations are weighted nearly double the amount than the European
annotations.

Limitations of this approach are that information about the structure of the underlying latent features
are unknown and balancing the network requires a lot of time and work. Therefore, we additionally
propose another approach, described in the following section.

4.3 DEBIASING NEURAL NETWORK

4.3.1 TRAINING NETWORK FEATURES

Regular convolutional neural networks (CNN) are generally used for face recognition tasks and we
also used CNNs for FBP. They can be used to classify identities, and in our case to classify aesthetic
scores (Serengil & Ozpinar, 2020), commonly called Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP). FBP using
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has been researched and improved many times in the
past by various researches (Eisenthal et al., 2006; Gerlach et al., 2020; Kagian et al., 2008; Xie et al.,
2015b; Liang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019).

Common for all those studies is that data is often generated by subgroups, with their own characteristics and behaviours (Mehrabi et al., 2019), especially in the highly subjective field of aesthetic rating.
Therefore, the possibility exists, that all datasets are affected by bias, which the networks trained on
them transfer into the FBP. Solving this problem, training an unbiased network with biased data, is a
recently much discussed subject in the area of Machine Learning (Amini et al., 2019; Bellamy et al.,
2018).

To achieve the first results on unbiased aesthetic estimation, we used the existing VGG-Face framework in Keras with TensorFlow and adjusted it. The network consists of 11 blocks, each containing a


-----

linear operator and followed by one or more non-linearities such as ReLU and max pooling (Parkhi
et al., 2015). We apply transfer learning here and use the pretrained model for Face Recognition
(Parkhi et al., 2015). Building up on the face recognition, attractiveness estimation is similar to
age estimation (Gyawali et al., 2020) performed by observing the facial features from portraits.
Comparable to age estimation, the network then assigns the Portrait a beauty score.

The convolutional layers in the network are followed by a rectification layer (ReLu) as in (Krizhevsky
et al., 2017). We used the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2017). The input to our network is a face
image of the size 256 × 256 × 3, and it uses Zero-Padding around the edges, to ensure that the image
information on the edge is not lost. Our input data is split into 60% train and 40% test data. The
convolutional layers parameters of VGG-Face are not changed and kept frozen during the training.
We use a dropout of 50%, and as it is a regression problem our final layer must be the size of 1. To
classify the aesthetic score, a softmax activation function is used in the final layer. As a loss metric,
we use the mean squared error and to compare our networks we also calculate the Pearson correlation
and the root mean squared error.

4.3.2 BALANCED TRAINING

The process and the effect of the ratio on the average aesthetic rating is shown in fig. 8. By modifying
the ratio of the annotations a minimum is determined that illustrates the lowest difference between the
average aesthetic prediction of Asian and European faces. This represents a specific loss function for
our network that maps bias onto measurable values. To remove bias from our network, we calculate
the difference between European and Asian aesthetic predictions and find the global minimum.

Figure 9: CNN aesthetic prediction with equalised distribution of training data. The charts on the left
side show the prediction of the network if it is only trained on Chinese or German annotations. On
the right side, the prediction of the network, which was trained on the biased data is shown. All bars
have more or less the same height and only differ minimally. This means, that we could eliminate
most of the bias in the training data, by balancing and we can assume that this trained network is fair.

The minimum of the average aesthetic score between Asian and European faces is located at a
ratio of 1:1.9 where the average aesthetic score differs by about 5%. We create a model with a fair
performance over all classes of different ethnicities as shown in fig. 9. This proves, that by resampling
and balancing the training data a less biased AI can be created. We are retaining the precision in FBP,
as shown in table 1. This process creates a less-biased AI in FBP tasks.

Our results are displayed in fig. 9 where all bar charts have a similar height and the FBP score is
considerably less biased. Not all bars have the exact same height, this is due to some background
noise. Real world data usually contains noise which affects tasks such as classification in machine
learning (Gupta & Gupta, 2019). This noise also affects our aesthetic prediction, however with
those minor differences, we can consider our network as unbiased and therefore fair. As we use a
factor based approach to multiply the annotation data, this noise is present over all ratios. Only the
difference of the averages increases or decreases within the variations of the ratio.

5 CONCLUSION

Our two main contributions are AestheticNet and a new approach to bias-free machine learning tools.
In this work, we have proposed to augment the SCUT-FBP dataset by synthesised GAN images
and show that AestheticNet predicts facial attractiveness with higher correlation then competitive
approaches. Then we utilise a novel learning strategy to minimise bias in networks. Unbiased
networks are an important step towards a future, where more decisions are made by AI and therefore
more lives are influenced by artificial intelligence - unbiased decision making is the foundation of
ethical and moral values.

Bias-free decision making is a challenging problem in machine learning tasks, yet it yields the great
potential to be one of the most significant strengths of an AI. We have shown a method to eliminate
bias in facial attractiveness prediction and this method can be transferred to multiple similar networks.

Training an unbiased model on biased data is an important goal from a Machine Learning Perspective,
as perfect, unbalanced data might be raw. Especially in the field of Aesthetic Judgement, it is
important that the machine is able to realise the bias. By learning, how to act against this bias, we
can scale this approach in the future on larger datasets in other areas. The algorithm is introduced
by applying it to aesthetic judgement, but not limited to it. Further development and deployment of
fair and unbiased AI systems is crucial for AI to be a social benefit for all and reduce algorithmic
discrimination.

Implicit bias has always been a hot-spot in the field of psychology in the 21[st] century. With the
intersection of disciplines, a series of moral and ethical issues arising from it have also attracted the
attention of the philosophical field. Implicit bias is widespread and is in a silent way. It affects all
aspects of our lives, even in the field of artificial intelligence, which is equally popular in the 21[st]
century. In this article, we have verified the universality of implicit existence and artificial intelligence
will copy human prejudice by proving the establishment of two hypotheses. On this basis, we have
analysed the reasons for the existence of implicit bias from neuroscience and psychology. Next,
we used experimental methods to systematically demonstrate how human implicit bias affects the
decision-making of artificial intelligence and found a way to eliminate the implicit bias of artificial
intelligence. Secondly, we improved the fairness of the algorithm from machine learning. From
a perspective, the training of unbiased models on biased data is an important goal, and unbiased
networks are an important step towards the future. In the future, artificial intelligence will make more
decisions, so more lives will be affected by artificial intelligence. Unbiased artificial intelligence
decision-making is the moral foundation.

One problem that has to be tackled in the future is the issue that our attractiveness was elo rated and
is hence not equally distributed per level of attractiveness. Very attractive and very unattractive faces
are much less common than average faces. In order to make up for that we used stargan v2 (Choi
et al., 2020) to enhance our data set by computer generated faced that are meant to be more attractive
than real faces. The generated images were rated in another survey and in fact came out to be more
attractive than real ones. As scientific AI-researchers, we require our work to maintain sufficient awe
of nature and morality. This is our current and future work. As Kant said, “Two things fill the mind
with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them:
the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.”

A SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

**Toolbox** The proposed toolbox introduces a huge collection of machine learning and face analysis
applications. Specifically, to evaluate the annotation data for discriminatory bias, we designed the
application that contains dedicated modules to detect correlations inside the network. The toolbox
itself consists of the following modules: (a) preparation of the annotated data, (b) statistics generator,
(c) dataset administration, (d) pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for hair colour, hair
style, skin complexion, (e) unbiased, non-discriminatory aesthetic scores, (f) facial landmark detector,
(g) 3D morphable model fitter.

**Pearson Correlation Coefficient** The Pearson correlation coefficient is a value between -1 and 1,
which is used to measure the correlation (linear correlation) between two variables X and Y; when
one variable increases, the other variable also increases, indicating that there is a positive correlation
between them, and the correlation coefficient is greater then 0; if one variable increases, the other
variable decreases, indicating that there is a negative correlation between them, and the correlation
coefficient is less than 0; if the correlation coefficient is equal to 0, there is no linearity correlation
relationship, if the correlation coefficient is equal to 1, it means that they are linearly equal, that is,
the scoring results after machine learning are completely equivalent to the artificial results of the
experimental participants in China and Germany.

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PC) is a statistic that measures linear correlation between the
annotation and the FBP of AestheticNet. The value of the PC is in the range of 1 to -1. 1 or -1 means
there is a high linear correlation. 0 means there is no correlation.

_ni=1[(][x][i][ −]_ _x[¯])(yi_ _y¯)_
_rxy =_ _ni=1P[(][x][i][ −]_ _x[¯])[2][pP][n]i=1 −[(][y][i][ −]_ _y[¯])[2]_ (2)
pP

**nMAE** To compare different approaches we needed to normalise the errors. With this normalisation
we are able to compare between datasets or models with different score ranges (e.g. beauty score
from 1-5 or 1-7) with ours, as we used a score range from 1-10. The error is expressed as a percentage,
lower values indicate less residual variance. In our case a lower nMAE or nRMSE indicates a higher
prediction accuracy on the dataset. The average of mean error is normalised over the total score range
(s).

_ft_ _at_
_nMAE =_ _|_ _−_ _|_ (3)

_smax_ _smin_

P _−_

**nRMSE** The RMSE is defined as the square root of the mean square error. It is a standard way to
measure the error of a model in predicting quantitative data.

_ni=1[( ˆ]yi_ _yi)[2]_

_RMSE =_ _−_ (4)

Though there is no consistent means of normalisation in the literature, our choice is to mean the range
of the measured data, which is the most common choice in normalisation. We divide the RMSE by
the score range (s).

_nRMSE =_ (5)

_smax_ _smin_

The ranges of values in the “annotations” columns in table 2 are defined as

(i) age: years (int)


(ii) gender: {0,1}

(iii) ethnic: [0,1]

(iv) height: meters (float)

(v) weight: kilograms (float)

(vi) sports: {Alpine Skiing, Biathlon Bobsleigh, Cross Country, Curling, Figure Skating,
_Freestyle Skiing, Ice Hockey, Luge, Short Track, Skeleton, Ski Jumping, Snowboard, Speed_
_Skating}_


-----

(vii) glasses: {0,1}

(viii) attractiveness: [0,1]


(ix) complexion: {fair, medium, olive, deep}

(x) hair colour: {blond, light brown, brown, dark brown, black}

(xi) hair style: {pony, short, long, occlusion eye, occlusion cheek}

To measure a bias, we evaluate our network on our database of synthetically created images (GAN),
called the Eurasian dataset. In this way we are able to classify the ethnicity exactly and evaluate the
difference of aesthetic score, being our bias. The idea of this experiment is that in a fair network,
ethnicity does not affect the aesthetic rating. In a fair network all lines should be at the same height
for the same age class, as mentioned in fig. 6.

B INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS OF AI

This section is a addition to the introduction of this work. While it does not provide information about
the technical issue, it provides an introduction the ethics that drive the development of AestheticNet.

B.1 MORAL ENHANCEMENT THROUGH AI

Faced with an increasingly diversified global environment, racial, religious, and cultural conflicts
continue, and human morality is also facing unprecedented challenges. Many scholars have put
forward the idea of human moral enhancement through technology, such as biotechnology, these
interventions include the use of various substances, such as oxytocin and serotonin, as well as of
various techniques, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and the provision of neurofeedback
(Kelemen et al., 2015; Lara & Deckers, 2020).

The aim of these interventions would be to promote trust in others and to foster the desire to
collaborate, but the harm that biotechnology does to the human body has always been a matter of
concern. Many of us are biologically predisposed to have limited cognition and levels of altruism
(Baron-Cohen, 2012; Wallace et al., 2007).

Everyone has an implicit bias, although this is not entirely caused by biological reasons. The existence
of prejudice will lead to the problem of bias in machine learning, which has been proved in previous
experiments. Compared with biotechnology, artificial intelligence is more trustworthy in helping
humans with moral enhancement while it is improving the quality of human life. Especially existing
implicit bias interventions tend to produce limited effects. For example, an air quality detection
system installed on the road can remind us whether we should limit the number of private car trips
and reduce gas emissions (Lai & J., 2016). An intelligent virus tracking APP reminds you that you
might have come into contact with high-risk groups and that it is now necessary to consider home
isolation. Some researchers are very pessimistic about the moral nature of humans while Dietrich
is very optimistic about the possibilities of AI and believes that robots would have achieved that
“Copernican turn” inaccessible to most humans by their biological conditioning (Dietrich, 2011). AI
could monitor physical and environmental factors that affect moral decision-making, could identify
and make agents aware of their biases, and could advise agents on the right course of action, based
on the agent’s moral values (Kelemen et al., 2015).

B.2 SOCIAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY AI

Machine learning dominated by human training inevitably enables artificial intelligence to replicate
human bias, including human implicit bias. Implicit bias is a bias that may be unconscious or
uncontrollable. It exists in almost everyone, and the resulting social problems are endless. These
subconscious thoughts are learned through our experience and are so deeply rooted that we may ignore
them. Temporary unconscious bias may be the source of discriminatory and discriminatory practices.
For example, even though Americans consider themselves unbiased when measuring unconscious
stereotypes 90% of whites (Moule, 2009) and 50% of blacks associate negative characteristics with
black images. From the beginning of childhood, white children and children of colour have liked
white dolls (News, 2009).


-----

In 2010, child psychologist and University of Chicago professor Margaret Beale Spencer (leading
researcher in the field of child development) was hired by CNN as a consultant. Her team tested 133
children from schools with specific economic and demographic requirements. Tests have shown that
white children have a high reaction rate to “white prejudice”. They identify the colour of their skin as
positive, while darker skin is identified as negative. Dr. Spencer said that even black children are
prejudiced against whites, but far fewer than white children (Jill Billante et al., 2010).

According to a Reuters report in October 2018, Amazon’s AI recruiting tool discriminates against
women (Dastin, 2018). The research and development team at Amazon has been creating applications
since 2014 to check the performance of applicants using the trained AI recruitment engine. Despite
many years of experience and an exceptionally long maturation period, such obvious disadvantages
are difficult or even impossible to recognise. Judging from the resumes sent to Amazon by the AI
recruitment engine over the past ten years, most of them are men. The system automatically lowered
the ranks of the two women’s universities and associated the keyword “women” with “captain of the
women’s chess club”. As one of the nine major AI companies that go hand-in-hand with Google
and Facebook, the AI discrimination scandal that Amazon has fallen into has aroused considerable
repercussions in the field of artificial intelligence and has aroused heated discussions from all walks
of life.

On May 25, 2020, in Minnesota, USA, a black man died after being kneeled on by police for 7
minutes (Hill et al., 2020). In an interview with CBS, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Fry said, “I don’t
know if there is explicit or implicit racism, but racism is definitely involved”.

As we needed a larger dataset for image annotation, we use recently published generative adversarial
networks (GAN), such as StarGAN-v2 (Choi et al., 2020). For our annotation process we create
portraits of females and manually selected outcomes with no or only very few artefacts. In the
annotation process, the annotators label a mix of GAN images and real images from the SCUT
FBP (Liang et al., 2018) dataset. After we evaluate the results of the annotation, we realise that
the highest annotations are dominated by images generated with StarGAN. With our dataset, we
experience no uncanny valley problems. We can assume that during clicking the border between
real person and synthetically generated person blurs. This is also demonstrated on the website
_thispersondoesnotexist.com with the accompanying publication by Karras et al. (Karras et al., 2019)._
In addition, generative networks producing synthetically generated portraits and animations, called
deepfakes, are currently on the rise. Simultaneously, due to current circumstances, meetings using
video-calls are currently on the rise. It could be argued that soon, within a video call, it will not
possible to differentiate between a real human being or a deepfake of a person by vision alone. This
creates many more questions on social problems which might be created by AI.

C WHAT IS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS?

Obviously, unconscious bias is a kind of prejudice that can be expressed as positive preference or
negative discrimination. Favouritism is morally acceptable in many cases. A preference for both
one’s own inner group, such as family and friends, and for the support of a weak social group usually
does not trigger the exclusion of external groups. The preference in this case did not lead to obvious
social problems. However, if the prejudice encompasses a large, specific group, such as ethnicity,
gender, or age, then moral and ethical problems are more likely to arise.

Another situation is that when the result of preference leads to unfair treatment of a certain individual
or group, discrimination also occurs, and its counterpart is explicit bias. Inner group preference is a
common cause of unconscious bias, but as explained earlier, it is also likely to lead to discrimination.

Unconscious bias is often used interchangeably with implicit bias in the fields of philosophy and
psychology. Because unconscious bias is literally easier to understand and accept by the general
public, it is used more often in a wider range of everyday language. Implicit bias was first defined
by psychologists Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald in 1995, where they argued that social
behaviour is largely influenced by unconscious associations and judgements, corresponding to it is
explicit bias.

However, most psychologists have abandoned Freud’s psychoanalytic theory of unconscious mental
processes. Unconscious bias usually manifests as a stereotype of things. It manifests in many forms
and often occurs in our daily lives. The most common manifestations are prejudices and stereotypes


-----

about affinity, gender, or the appearance of people. For example, the unconscious bias of the title
professor is automatically assigned to the portrayal of an older man, although there are also many
young and female professors. In addition, many people have the stereotype that women are worse at
math problems and better at verbal problems than men (Johns et al., 2005).

Affinity bias refers to when you unconsciously prefer people who share qualities with you or someone
you like. This bias was also verified in our first part of the experiment. Networks trained by Europeans
think European faces are more beautiful than Asian faces, in contrast, networks trained by Asians
think Asian faces are more beautiful than European faces. A study at Yale shows the “male” candidate
was judged to be more talented and experienced; he was selected for the job more often and at a
higher salary (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012).

Obviously, this is a gender bias. And when you unconsciously notice people’s appearances and
associate it with their personality, you might have beauty bias. Untidy appearance does not mean
that this is a person who lacks the ability to manage themselves. A person in shabby clothes may be
economical but he is not necessarily poor. Unconscious biases like these happen to everyone every
day. And as proved later in our experiment, the bias in the training data is likely to be given to the
artificial intelligence, which replicates the bias.

C.1 CAUSES OF UNCONSCIOUS BIAS

**1. Susceptibility to bias.** We are used to the brain’s fast, emotional, unconscious thinking mode.
Kahneman states in (Kahneman, 2011) that there are two systems in the brain to organise our daily
life: System 1 and System 2. Fast, emotional, and unconscious activities like driving, talking, or
cleaning use System 1 since it requires little or even no effort, but it is often prone to errors. System 2
is slow, logical, effortful, conscious thought, where reason dominates. System 1 is a kind of mental
shortcut, and we take this shortcut. Rules of thumb, educated guesses, and using “common sense”
are all forms of mental shortcuts. Implicit bias is a result of taking one of these cognitive shortcuts
inaccurately (Rynders, 2019). As a result, we incorrectly rely on these unconscious stereotypes
to provide guidance in a very complex world. Especially when we are under high levels of stress
we are more likely to rely on these biases than to examine all the relevant surrounding information
(Wigboldus et al., 2004).

**2. We seek patterns.** One key reason we develop such biases is that our brains have a natural
tendency to look for patterns and associations in order to make sense of a very complicated world.
Research shows that even before kindergarten, children already use their group membership (e.g.,
racial group, gender group, age group, etc.) to guide inferences about the psychological and behavioural traits. At such a young age, they have already begun to seek out patterns and recognise
what distinguishes them from other groups. Not only do children recognise what sets them apart
from other groups, they believe “what is similar to me is good, and what is different from me is bad”
(Cameron et al., 2001). Children aren’t just noticing how similar or dissimilar they are to others, but
also that dissimilar people are actively disliked (Aboud, 1989). Recognising what sets you apart
from others and then forming negative opinions about those outgroups (a social group with which an
individual does not identify) contributes to the development of implicit biases.

**3. Social and cultural influences.** Influences from media, culture, education, and your individual
upbringing can also contribute to the rise of implicit associations that people form about the members
of social outgroups. Media has become increasingly accessible, and while that has many benefits, it
can also lead to implicit biases.

The way TV portrays individuals, or the language journal articles use, can ingrain specific biases in
our mind. They can lead us to associate Black people as criminals or females as nurses or teachers.
How children are raised can also play an important role. One research study found that parental racial
attitudes can influence children’s implicit prejudice (Sinclair et al., 2005). Parents are not the only
figures who can influence such attitudes. Siblings, the school setting, and the culture in which you
grow up can also play a role in shaping your explicit beliefs and implicit biases.

Social education also has a powerful effect because it includes not only traditional school education
but also family education and self-study. Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding,
knowledge, behaviour, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences (Gross, 2010).

From a blank sheet of paper at birth to receiving education and learning, gaining knowledge and
gradually forming their values and understanding of surrounding things, there is no doubt that
education and learning play a vital role in a person’s will and thinking. A common belief is that
education is an important determinant to racial prejudice, and there is preliminary evidence that the
effect of this education varies from country to country (Hello et al., 2002).

Research scholars have found that the Polish education system plays a decisive role in the nationalism
and prejudice of students (Zuk, 2018). In the medical field, because the attitude of medical staff to[˙]
obese individuals has contributed to discrimination and led to poor health, the medical education
environment may have explicit and implicit biases against obesity. Researchers who have adopted
innovative educational interventions (read about obesity drama) found that it has a significant effect
on reducing implicit prejudice against obese people (Matharu et al., 2014).

C.2 INFLUENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Numerous studies show that human-trained machines repeat human bias (Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2018;
Stephens-Davidowitz, 2014; Munger, 2017; Horvitz, 2017). The assumption is to create unbiased
artificial intelligence by inserting labelled data from people who are free of prejudice. Unfortunately,
everyone is biased because a large part of human bias is unconscious and hard to detect. Unconscious
prejudices affect 90 to 95 percent of people. Psychologists demonstrated this at a press conference
at the University of Washington and presented a new tool that measures the unconscious roots of
prejudice (Schwarz, 1998).

All science suffers from human bias. Even if we train giant robots to collect, store, and manipulate
data for us, the ultimate observers, in the final analysis interpreters, and mediators of that data, are
humans (Mukherjee, 2016).

Unconscious bias comes from the education background, the culture, attitudes, and stereotypes we
pick up from the world we live in, and research over time and from different countries shows that it
tends to line up with general social hierarchies. In words, unconscious bias is part of human nature
and affects everyone, whether they realise it or not. Therefore, we can only try to avoid it and work
with biased data; there is no way to completely eliminate it.

What is the significance of our research for the society? Firstly, from the field of image vision that we
are engaged in, AI bias also exists in the field of image processing. Artificial intelligence applications
tag pictures of White American brides as “brides”, “dresses”, and “weddings” while pictures of North
Indian brides are tagged as “performing arts” and “costumes” (Shankar et al., 2017). Angwin’s and
Larson’s (Larson & Angwin, 2016) analysis of ethical bias has prompted research showing that the
disparity can be addressed if the algorithms focus on the fairness of outcomes. That which applies
automatic labels to pictures in digital photo albums, was classifying images of black people as gorillas
(BBC, 2015). Since the data set does not contain enough ethnic minorities, the artificial intelligence
judges which designed by beauty. AI does not like black-skinned women (beauty.ai, 2016). Just
imagine this would be a job position for a cover model position: there is no doubt that candidates
with black skin will be rejected.

Although both Hume (David, 1898) and Kant (Kant & Guyer, 2000) believe that aesthetic judgement
is only a subjective feeling which regarding the pleasure that we take from a beautiful object, and
aesthetics itself is neither right nor wrong nor moral, the behaviour caused by aesthetic judgements is
related to morality (Cui et al., 2019; Haidt, 2001). Many studies show that unfair recruitment cases are
encountered due to aesthetic judgements (Maddox & Perry, 2018; Mason, 2017; Beattie & Johnson,
2012). More attractive people have higher incomes than less attractive individuals (Any´zovˇ a &´
Matejˇ u, 2018; French, 2002; Cawley, 2004). More and more companies use AI enhanced recruitment˚
systems, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Unilever. The fairness of the image processing system is
very important to the entire AI recruitment system. Our research provides a practical example of how
to build a fair and unbiased AI.

Furthermore, through this research, we hope the unconscious bias will get more social attention by
studying how unconscious bias affects decision-making in artificial intelligence. What is gratifying
is that many companies are beginning to pay attention to the negatives that unconscious bias may
entail and are making continuous efforts. Examples are Google (Google LLC, 2016) and Facebook
(Facebook Inc., 2014). They are strengthening the training of employees in this area. Facebook

designed a webpage to make unconscious bias training videos widely available and Google has put
about 60,000 employees through a 90-minute unconscious bias training program. This will help
reduce human bias during human-computer interaction, but the economic cost of the training is also
huge. If there is an artificial intelligence similar to our research that can better circumvent human
unconscious biases it would be a viable alternative.

D.1 EVALUATION OF UNBIASED NETWORK

We compare our method with other state-of-the-art approaches on the SCUT-FBP500 datasets. As
shown in table 3 our AestheticNet therefore significantly surpasses previous approaches, which is
mainly due to the augmentation with synthetic images and the optimisation of the previous approaches.
In our best experiment, we achieve a Pearson correlation of 0.9601, a normalised mean average error
of 3.896% and a normalised root mean squared error of 5.580%. The results are normalised because
there are different datasets with different score ranges.

Having a state-of-the-art aesthetic prediction network, we then train a third CNN on the features
from the Asian and German labelled networks to generate a non-biased network. Therefore, the
synthesised Eurasian dataset is used with a categorical-cross-entropy-loss-function to converge the
subgroup’s intersection points of fig. 6.

D.1.1 REMOVING BIAS USING CLUSTERED LABELS

A more sophisticated approach in getting rid of the bias in training data is our second approach.
Within this we are developing a new method to reduce the bias in the training data. This method


-----

consists of a deep learning network that is trained on the original learning task within the data set, and
then minimises the bias inside the learned latent distributions using a specially adapted loss function.

Each data record contains a list of labels a = a1, ..., an, which are to be debiased, and a further list
of labels b = b1, ..., bn. In this example we remove the bias from the ethnical label a1 and preserve
the age, profession, hair colour and skin complexion labels. The network evaluates all attributes of
the data set during the training and groups all objects according to the attributes b in clusters.

Within each subgroup the difference between the ethnical mean value a1 represents the bias. A
nonlinear operation, similar to the gamma correction in image systems, is then applied to the ethnic
label to preserve the range of the values and bring the differences closer together. These differences
for all clusters are the measure of the loss function, which is implemented as categorical cross entropy
loss and should be minimised during training. With this we present a universally adaptable method to
make any network fairer according to given labels.
